# Complete Repository Structure (Historical)

This document used to be the primary structure guide, but it describes a refactoring-era layout where Common Crawl tooling lived under `municipal_scrape_workspace.ccindex`.

## Current Structure

See [docs/REPO_STRUCTURE.md](docs/REPO_STRUCTURE.md) for the current, accurate two-package layout.
