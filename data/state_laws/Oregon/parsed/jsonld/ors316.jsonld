(d) As used in this subsection, U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index means the U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (All Items) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor.

(1) As used in this section: (a) Material participation has the meaning given that term in section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code. (b) Nonpassive income means income other than income from passive activity as determined under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code. Nonpassive income does not include wages, interest, dividends or capital gains. (c) Nonpassive loss means loss other than loss from passive activity as determined under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code. (d) Qualifying income means a taxpayers net income that meets the conditions of subsections (6) to (10) of this section, as reported on the taxpayers return, and that is computed by taking the sum of the taxpayers: (A) Nonpassive income after reduction for nonpassive losses; and (B) Business income or loss as a sole proprietor. (2) If a taxpayer that meets the conditions of subsections (6) to (10) of this section has nonpassive income attributable to any partnership or S corporation after reduction for nonpassive losses or does business as a sole proprietorship, that portion of the taxpayers income that is qualifying income shall be taxed at: (a) The rate applicable under ORS 316.037; or (b) At the election of the taxpayer, a rate of: (A) Seven percent of the first $500,000 of taxable income, or fraction thereof; (B) Seven and one-half percent of taxable income exceeding $500,000 but not exceeding $1 million; (C) Eight percent of taxable income exceeding $1 million but not exceeding $2.5 million; (D) Nine percent of taxable income exceeding $2.5 million but not exceeding $5 million; and (E) Nine and nine-tenths percent of taxable income exceeding $5 million. (3) The reduced rates allowed under subsection (2)(b) of this section may be adjusted as provided in ORS 316.044. (4) A taxpayer shall use the subtractions, deductions or additions otherwise allowed under this chapter in the calculation of income that is taxed at the rates otherwise applicable under ORS 316.037. The only addition or subtraction allowed in the calculation of qualifying income for which the taxpayer uses the reduced rates allowed under subsection (2)(b) of this section shall be any depreciation adjustment directly related to the partnership, S corporation or sole proprietorship. (5) The election under subsection (2)(b) of this section shall be irrevocable and shall be made on the taxpayers original return. If the taxpayer uses the reduced rates allowed under subsection (2)(b) of this section, the calculation of income shall be substantiated on a form prescribed by the Department of Revenue and filed with the taxpayers tax return for the tax year or at such other time and manner as the department may prescribe by rule. A taxpayer who uses the reduced rates available under subsection (2)(b) of this section may not join in the filing of a composite return under ORS 314.778. (6) The rates listed in subsection (2)(b) of this section apply to income attributable to a partnership, S corporation or sole proprietorship only if: (a) The taxpayer materially participates in the trade or business; (b) For a partnership or S corporation, the partnership or S corporation has ordinary business income not in excess of $5 million for the tax year; and (c) For a partnership or S corporation, the trade or business complies with the employee ratio requirements of subsections (8) and (9) of this section or with the income distribution requirements of subsection (10) of this section. (7) To qualify under this section, a partnership, S corporation or sole proprietorship: (a) Must employ at least one person who is not an owner, member or limited partner of the partnership or S corporation or who is not the sole proprietor; (b) Must have at least 1,200 aggregate hours of work in Oregon performed, by the close of the tax year for which the reduced rate is allowed, by persons who meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection and who are employed by the partnership, S corporation or sole proprietorship; and (c) May rely only on hours worked in a week in which a worker works at least 30 hours, in determining whether the requirement in paragraph (b) of this subsection is met. (8) If the ordinary business income of a partnership or S corporation exceeds $250,000, but does not exceed $500,000, for every owner, member or limited partner, the partnership or S corporation must, through the employment of persons who meet the requirements of subsection (7)(a) to (c) of this section: (a) Employ in Oregon at least one person who is not an owner, member or limited partner; and (b) Have at least 1,200 aggregate hours of work in Oregon performed by employees, while considering not more than 1,200 hours performed by any one employee in that sum. (9) Unless the income distribution requirements of subsection (10) of this section are met, a partnership or S corporation must, through the employment of persons who meet the requirements of subsection (7)(a) to (c) of this section, obtain the following ratios of owners, members or limited partners to employees: (a) If the ordinary business income of a partnership or S corporation exceeds $500,000, but does not exceed $1 million, for every owner, member or limited partner, the partnership or S corporation must, by the close of the tax year: (A) Employ in Oregon at least two persons who are not owners, members or limited partners; and (B) Have at least 2,400 aggregate hours of work in Oregon performed by employees, while considering not more than 1,200 hours performed by any one employee in that sum.

(c) If the ordinary business income of a partnership or S corporation exceeds $2.5 million, but does not exceed $5 million, for every owner, member or limited partner, the partnership or S corporation must, by the close of the tax year: (A) Employ in Oregon at least 10 persons who are not owners, members or limited partners; and (B) Have at least 12,000 aggregate hours of work in Oregon performed by employees, while considering not more than 1,200 hours performed by any one employee in that sum. (10) Unless the employee ratio requirements of subsection (9) of this section are met, if the ordinary business income of the partnership or S corporation exceeds $250,000, the distributions of income of a partnership or S corporation, as a percentage of ordinary business income, may not exceed 25 percent. This percentage shall be computed based on the total distributions and total ordinary business income for the current tax year, summed with up to the two most recent tax years, or as many tax years for which the partnership or S corporation has been operating, if fewer than two full years. An amount less than zero in any year shall be treated as zero for that year. (11)(a) A nonresident may apply the reduced rates allowed under subsection (2)(b) of this section only to income earned in Oregon. (b) A part-year resident shall calculate the tax due using the reduced rates allowed under subsection (2)(b) of this section by first applying those rates to the taxpayers qualifying income, and then multiplying that amount by the ratio of the taxpayers income in Oregon divided by income from all sources.",

(2) The credit provided under this section shall not exceed the proportion of the tax otherwise due under this chapter that the amount of the modified adjusted gross income of the taxpayer derived from sources in the other state bears to the entire modified adjusted gross income of the taxpayer. (3) The Department of Revenue shall provide by rule the procedure for obtaining credit provided by this section and the proof required. The requirement of proof may be waived partially, conditionally or absolutely, as provided under ORS 315.063. (4) No credit allowed under this section or ORS 316.292 shall be applied in calculating tax due under this chapter if the tax upon which the credit is based has been claimed as a deduction, unless the tax upon which the credit is based is restored to income on the Oregon return. (5) Credit shall not be allowed under this section for income taxes paid to a state that allows a nonresident a credit against the income taxes imposed by that state for taxes paid or payable to the state of residence. It is the purpose of this subsection to avoid duplicative taxation through use of a nonresident, rather than a resident, credit for taxes paid or payable to another state. (6) The Department of Revenue may adopt rules under this section that provide a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter when the department considers the credit necessary to avoid taxation of the same income by this state and another state. (7) As used in this section: (a) Modified adjusted gross income means federal adjusted gross income as modified by this chapter and the other laws of this state applicable to personal income taxation. (b) Oregon partnership means an entity that is treated as a partnership for Oregon excise and income tax purposes. (c) Oregon S corporation means a corporation that has elected S corporation status for Oregon excise and income tax purposes. (d) State means a state, district, territory or possession of the United States. (8) For purposes of this section: (a) A direct tax imposed upon income of an Oregon S corporation is an income tax imposed on the Oregon S corporation. (b) An excise tax that is measured by income of an Oregon S corporation is an income tax imposed on the Oregon S corporation. (c) An excise tax is measured by income only if the statute imposing the excise tax provides that the base for the excise tax: (A) Includes revenue from sales and from services rendered, and income from investments; and (B) Permits a deduction for the cost of goods sold and the cost of services rendered.",

(b) In the case of an individual with respect to whom a credit under paragraph (a) of this subsection is allowable to another taxpayer for a taxable year beginning in the calendar year in which the individuals taxable year begins, the credit amount applicable to such individual for such individuals taxable year is zero. (2)(a) A nonresident shall be allowed the credit provided under subsection (1) of this section computed in the same manner and subject to the same limitations as the credit allowed to a resident of this state. However, the credit shall be prorated using the proportion provided in ORS 316.117. (b) If a change in the taxable year of a taxpayer occurs as described in ORS 314.085, or if the Department of Revenue terminates the taxpayers taxable year under ORS 314.440, the credit allowed by this section shall be prorated or computed in a manner consistent with ORS 314.085. (c) If a change in the status of a taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit allowed by this section shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117. (3) The Department of Revenue shall recompute the dollar amount of the personal exemption credit allowed for state personal income tax purposes. The computation shall be as follows: (a) Divide the monthly averaged U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for the 12 consecutive months ending August 31 of the prior calendar year by the monthly averaged index for the first six months of 1986. (b) Recompute the dollar amount of the personal exemption credit by multiplying $90 by the appropriate indexing factor determined as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection. Round off the amount obtained under this paragraph to the nearest $1. (4) As used in this section, U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index means the U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (All Items) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. (5) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (3) of this section, a taxpayer may not claim the personal exemption credit otherwise allowed under this section if the taxpayers federal adjusted gross income for the tax year exceeds $200,000 for joint return filers, a surviving spouse or a head of household, or $100,000 for an individual who is not a married individual and is not a surviving spouse, or is a married individual who files a separate return.",

(3) In addition to the personal exemption credit allowed by this chapter for state personal income tax purposes for a dependent of the taxpayer, for a taxpayer with federal adjusted gross income that does not exceed $100,000, there shall be allowed an additional personal exemption credit for a child with a disability if the child is a child with a disability at the close of the tax year. The amount of the credit allowed for the dependent for the tax year shall be calculated as provided in ORS 316.085. (4) Each taxpayer qualifying for the additional personal exemption credit allowed by this section may claim the credit on the personal income tax return. However, the claim shall be substantiated by any proof of entitlement to the credit as may be required by the state board by rule.

      "text": "Credit for alternative energy device; rules. (1)(a) A resident individual shall be allowed a credit against the taxes otherwise due under this chapter for costs paid or incurred for construction or installation of each of one or more alternative energy devices in or at a dwelling. (b) A credit against the taxes otherwise due under this chapter is not allowed for an alternative energy device that does not meet or exceed all applicable federal, state and local requirements for energy efficiency, including equipment codes, state and federal appliance standards, the state building code, specialty codes and any other standards. (2)(a) For each category one alternative energy device other than an alternative fuel device or an alternative energy device that uses solar radiation for domestic water heating or swimming pool heating, the credit allowed under this section may not exceed the lesser of 50 percent of the cost of the alternative energy device or $1,500, and shall be computed as follows: (A) For a category one alternative energy device that is not an alternative fuel device, the credit shall be based upon the first year energy yield of the alternative energy device that qualifies under ORS 469B.100 to 469B.118. The amount of the credit shall be the same whether for collective or noncollective investment. (B) For each category one alternative energy device for a dwelling, the credit shall be based upon the first year energy yield in kilowatt hours per year multiplied by 60 cents per dwelling utilizing the alternative energy device used for space heating, cooling, electrical energy or domestic water heating. (C) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, for each category one alternative energy device used for swimming pool, spa or hot tub heating, the credit shall be based upon the first year energy yield in kilowatt hours per year multiplied by 15 cents. (b) For each alternative fuel device, the credit allowed under this section may not exceed the lesser of 50 percent of the cost of the alternative fuel device or $750. (c) For each category one alternative energy device that uses solar radiation for: (A) Domestic water heating, the credit allowed under this section shall be based upon 50 percent of the cost of the device or the first year energy yield in kilowatt hours per year multiplied by $2, whichever is lower, up to $6,000. (B) Swimming pool heating, the credit allowed under this section shall be based upon 50 percent of the cost of the device or the first year energy yield in kilowatt hours per year multiplied by 20 cents, whichever is lower, up to $2,500. (d)(A) For each category two alternative energy device that is a solar electric system or fuel cell system, the credit allowed under this section may not exceed the lesser of $3 per watt of installed output or $6,000. (B) For each category two alternative energy device that is a wind electric system, the credit allowed under this section may not exceed the lesser of $6,000 or the first year energy yield in kilowatt hours per year multiplied by $2. (3)(a) Notwithstanding subsection (2)(a), (c) or (d) of this section, the total amount of the credits allowed in any one tax year may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer or $1,500 for each alternative energy device, whichever is less. Unused credit amounts may be carried forward as provided in subsection (8) of this section, but may not be carried forward to a tax year that is more than five tax years following the first tax year for which any credit was allowed with respect to the category two alternative energy device that is the basis for the credit. (b) Notwithstanding subsection (2)(d) of this section, the total amount of the credit for each device allowed under subsection (2)(d) of this section may not exceed 50 percent of the total installed cost of the category two alternative energy device. (4) The State Department of Energy may by rule provide for a lesser amount of incentive for each type of alternative energy device as market conditions warrant. (5) To qualify for a credit under this section, all of the following are required: (a) The alternative energy device must be purchased, constructed, installed and operated in accordance with ORS 469B.100 to 469B.118 and a certificate issued thereunder. (b) The taxpayer who is allowed the credit must be the owner or contract purchaser of the dwelling or dwellings served by the alternative energy device or the tenant of the owner or of the contract purchaser and must: (A) Use the dwelling or dwellings served by the alternative energy device as a principal or secondary residence; or (B) Rent or lease, under a residential rental agreement, the dwelling or dwellings to a tenant who uses the dwelling or dwellings as a principal or secondary residence. (c) The credit must be claimed for the tax year in which the alternative energy device was purchased if the device is operational by April 1 of the next following tax year. (6) The credit provided by this section does not affect the computation of basis under this chapter. (7) The total credits allowed under this section in any one year may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer. (8) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayers tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise any credit not used in that second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that third succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fourth succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that fourth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fifth succeeding tax year, but may not be carried forward for any tax year thereafter. (9) A nonresident shall be allowed the credit under this section in the proportion provided in ORS 316.117.

(11) If a change in the status of a taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit allowed by this section shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117.

(b) For purposes of this section, if any distributions (lump sum or periodic) received by a resident individual from a plan or trust described in subsection (2) of this section meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection, then for purposes of the subtraction allowed by this section, those distributions shall be considered to be the distributions first received by the individual after the individual has become a resident of this state. (c) For purposes of ORS 316.082 (credit for taxes paid to another state), any distributions received by a resident individual from a plan or trust described in subsection (2) of this section which meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be considered income subject to tax under this chapter notwithstanding the exclusion under this section. (2) A plan or trust is described in this section if: (a) The plan or trust is an individual retirement account described in section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code; (b) The trust forms part of a pension or profit-sharing plan that provides contributions or benefits for employees, some or all of whom are owner-employees, as defined under section 401(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; (c) The plan or trust is an annuity contract purchased on behalf of an employee of a charitable organization or public school as described under section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code; or (d) The plan or trust is an eligible deferred compensation plan established and maintained by an employer that is a state or local government, a political subdivision thereof, or a tax exempt organization, on behalf of an employee of the employer, as described under section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code. (3) The following contributions are not contributions to which the subtraction under subsection (1) of this section is accorded: (a) Contributions made during a tax period, or portion thereof, for which the taxpayer was a nonresident required to file an Oregon return, to the extent that a deduction or exclusion was allowable under this chapter for those contributions; or (b) Contributions for which the taxpayer was allowed a credit for taxes paid to another state under ORS 316.082. (4) A subtraction shall not be allowed under this section for interest or other income arising from investment of contributions made to a plan or trust described in subsection (2) of this section. (5) For purposes of the subtraction allowed under subsection (1) of this section: (a) Distributions received by the taxpayer from a plan or trust described in subsection (2) of this section shall be considered to initially consist of a recovery of contributions. (b) Once the distributions equal the cumulative contributions, all further distributions shall constitute interest or other income arising from investment of the contributions. (6) The Department of Revenue may adopt rules requiring substantiation of the contributions and tax treatment upon which the subtraction under this section is based. Failure to provide substantiation as required under the rules shall result in denial of the subtraction otherwise allowed under this section. The requirement for substantiation may be waived partially, conditionally or absolutely, as provided under ORS 315.063.",

(1) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, if the Department of Revenue makes the findings required under subsection (2) of this section, the department may require any employer subject to ORS 316.162 to 316.221, except the state or its political subdivisions, to post a surety bond, or irrevocable letter of credit issued by an insured institution, as defined in ORS 706.008, with the department, to secure future payment of amounts required to be withheld and paid over to the department under ORS 316.162 to 316.221 or 320.550. The bond or letter of credit shall be in an amount equal to the amounts required to be withheld upon the wages paid or estimated to be paid by the employer for a period of four calendar quarters. The bond or letter of credit shall be in a form acceptable to the department. Posting of the bond or letter of credit shall not relieve the employer from withholding and paying over amounts based on wages paid by the employer under any provision of ORS 316.162 to 316.221 or 320.550. The department may, in its discretion, at any time apply such bond or letter of credit or part thereof to the delinquencies or indebtedness of the employer arising under any provision of ORS 316.162 to 316.221 and 320.550 and accruing after the date the bond or letter of credit was posted. Appeal of an action of the department under this section shall not relieve an employer of the requirement during the pendency of the appeal. (2) Before requiring an employer to post a bond or irrevocable letter of credit under subsection (1) of this section, the department shall determine that the employer has failed to make payment to the department of amounts required to be withheld and paid over under any provision of ORS 316.162 to 316.221 or 320.550 for at least three calendar quarters, and the total amount of delinquent payments exceeds $2,500, exclusive of interest or penalties. For purposes of this subsection, a payment shall not be considered delinquent if the employers liability to withhold is subject to appeal to the tax court. (3) The department shall not require a bond or irrevocable letter of credit to be posted under this section if the employer elects to notify the department of the times of payment of wages to the employees of the employer, and, notwithstanding ORS 316.197, to pay over amounts withheld within three banking days after the dates the wages were paid. (4) Before requiring an employer to post a bond or irrevocable letter of credit or make payment of amounts required to be withheld in the manner prescribed in subsection (3) of this section, the department shall attempt to obtain payment of delinquent amounts through other methods of collection, however, the department is not required to seize or sell real or personal property in order to comply with the requirements of this subsection. (5) Any bond or irrevocable letter of credit required under subsection (1) of this section shall become the sole property of the department and shall be held by the department to guarantee payment of withholding taxes by the employer. The bond or letter of credit shall be held for the benefit of the State of Oregon, subject only to the provisions of subsection (6) of this section. The bond or letter of credit shall be prior to all other liens, claims or encumbrances and shall be exempt from any process, attachment, garnishment or execution. (6) If an employer ceases to be an employer subject to ORS 316.162 to 316.221 or 320.550, the department shall, upon receipt of all payments due from the employer for withheld amounts, cancel any bond or irrevocable letter of credit given under this section. Such bonds or letters of credit held for the benefit of the State of Oregon shall first be applied to any indebtedness or deficiencies due from the employer under ORS 316.162 to 316.221 and 320.550 and accruing after the date the bond or letter of credit was posted before any return is made to the employer. The employer shall have no interest in such bond or letter of credit prior to full compliance with this section and all provisions of ORS 316.162 to 316.221 and 320.550. (7) If an employer required to post a bond or irrevocable letter of credit or make payment of amounts withheld in the manner prescribed under this section makes full payment of all delinquent amounts due and owing at the time the bond, letter of credit or accelerated payment schedule was required and makes payment of amounts due under ORS 316.162 to 316.221 and 320.550 and files returns required in connection with those payments in a timely manner for the succeeding four calendar quarters, the department shall release the employer from the requirement to post the bond or letter of credit or make accelerated payments of amounts withheld. (8) If any employer fails to comply with subsections (1) to (7) of this section, the Oregon Tax Court, upon commencement of an action by the department for that purpose, may order the employer to post the required bond or irrevocable letter of credit or make accelerated payments of amounts withheld. The employers failure to obey an order of the court is punishable by contempt. If the Oregon Tax Court determines that an order of compliance enforceable by contempt proceedings will not assure the payment of withheld taxes by the employer, the court may enjoin the employer from further employing individuals in this state or continuing in business therein until the employer has complied with subsections (1) to (7) of this section.",

(c) Designated distribution means any distribution or payment from or under an employer deferred compensation plan, an individual retirement plan or a commercial annuity. Designated distribution does not include any amount treated as wages as defined in ORS 316.162, the portion of any distribution or payment that is not includable in the gross income of the recipient or any distribution or payment made under section 404(k)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. (d) Employer deferred compensation plan means any pension, annuity, profit-sharing or stock bonus plan or other plan deferring the receipt of compensation. (e) Individual retirement plan means an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.

(2)(a) The payer of any periodic payment shall withhold from the payment the amount which would be required to be withheld from the payment under ORS 316.167 if the payment were wages paid by an employer to an employee. The time and manner of payment of withheld amounts to the department shall be the same as that required under ORS 316.197 for withholding of income taxes from wages. (b) The payer of any nonperiodic distribution shall withhold from the distribution an amount determined by the department. (c) The maximum amount to be withheld under this section on any designated distribution shall not exceed 10 percent of the amount of money and the fair market value of other property received in the distribution. If the distribution is not subject to withholding for federal income tax purposes under section 3405 of the Internal Revenue Code, it shall not be subject to withholding under this section. (3)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the payer of a designated distribution shall withhold and be liable for payment of amounts required to be withheld under this section. (b) In the case of any plan described in section 401(a), 403(a) or 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, or section 301(d) of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975, the plan administrator shall withhold and be liable for payment of amounts required to be withheld under this section, unless the plan administrator has directed the payer to withhold the tax and has provided the payer with the information required by rule of the department. (4)(a) An individual may elect to have no withholding by a payer under subsection (2) of this section. If an individual has elected to have no federal withholding from payments or distributions described in this section the individual shall be deemed to have elected no withholding for state purposes, unless the individual notifies the payer otherwise. (b) An election made under this subsection shall be effective as provided under rules promulgated by the department. The rules required under this paragraph shall provide the manner in which an election may be revoked and when the revocation shall be effective. (5) The payer of any periodic payment or nonperiodic distribution shall give notice to the payee of the right to make an election to have no state withholding from the payment or distribution.

The employer is charged with the duty of advising the employee of the amount of moneys withheld, in accordance with any regulations as the department may prescribe, using printed forms furnished or approved by the department for this purpose. (2) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, every employer shall submit a combined quarterly return to the department on a form provided by it showing the number of payments made and the withheld taxes paid during the quarter. The report shall be filed with the department on or before the last day of the month following the end of the quarter. (3) The employer shall make an annual return to the department on forms provided or approved by it, summarizing the total compensation paid and the taxes withheld for all employees during the calendar year and shall file the same with the department on or before the due date of the corresponding federal return for the year for which report is made. Failure to file the annual report without reasonable excuse on or before the 30th day after notice has been given to the employer of failure subjects the employer to a penalty of $100. The department may by rule require additional information the department finds necessary to substantiate the annual return, including but not limited to copies of federal form W-2 for individual employees, and may prescribe circumstances under which the filing requirement imposed by this subsection is waived. (4) The employer shall indicate on the return required by subsection (3) of this section whether the employer offers a qualified retirement plan, as listed in ORS 178.215 (8), that would allow the employer to obtain an exemption from offering employees enrollment in the retirement plan developed under ORS 178.205. The department shall provide a means on the return by which the employer may make this indication. (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, employers of agricultural employees may submit returns annually showing the number of payments made and the withheld taxes paid. However, such employers shall make and file a combined quarterly tax report with respect to other tax programs, as required by ORS 316.168. (6) In addition to any other penalty required by law: (a) A person who fails to substantiate a report required under subsection (3) of this section, or who files incomplete or incorrect substantiation, shall be subject to a penalty of $50 per federal form W-2 after the date on which the substantiation is due, up to a maximum penalty of $2,500. (b) A person who knowingly fails to substantiate a report required under subsection (3) of this section, or who knowingly files incomplete or incorrect substantiation, shall be subject to a penalty of $250 per federal form W-2 after the date on which the substantiation is due, up to a maximum penalty of $25,000.",

If the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or other authorized official of the federal government makes a correction resulting in a change of the decedents or the estate of the decedents tax for state income tax purposes, then notice of a deficiency under any law imposing tax upon or measured by income for the corresponding tax year may be mailed within one year after the department is notified by the fiduciary or the commissioner of such federal correction, or within the applicable 18-month or five-year period prescribed in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, respectively, whichever period later expires.

(c) Interest accruing under subsection (1) of this section shall not be imposed with respect to any underpayment of estimated tax if the department determines that: (A) In the tax year the estimated tax payment was required to be made or in the tax year preceding such tax year, the taxpayer (i) retired after having attained age 62 or (ii) became disabled; and (B) The underpayment was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. (d) Interest accruing under subsection (1) of this section shall not be imposed with respect to any underpayment of estimated tax attributable to the pro rata share of a shareholder of the income of an S corporation if: (A) The income is taxable income for an initial year for which S corporation status is elected for the corporation; and (B) The shareholder is a nonresident or for the preceding taxable year was a part-year resident for Oregon tax purposes. (6) For purposes of this section, the estimated tax shall be computed without any reduction for the amount of credit estimated to be allowed to the individual for the taxable year under ORS 316.187. The amount of the credit allowed under ORS 316.187 for the taxable year shall be considered a payment of estimated tax. An equal part of the credit shall be considered paid on each installment date for the taxable year, unless the taxpayer establishes the date on which all amounts were actually withheld, in which case the amount so withheld shall be considered payment of estimated tax on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld. (7) For purposes of subsections (5) and (8) of this section, the term tax means the tax imposed by this chapter minus any credits against tax allowed for purposes of this chapter, other than the credit against tax provided by ORS",

(2) There shall be added to federal taxable income: (a) Interest or dividends, exempt from federal income tax, on obligations or securities of any foreign state or of a political subdivision or authority of any foreign state.

(b) Interest or dividends on obligations of any authority, commission, instrumentality and territorial possession of the United States that by the laws of the United States are exempt from federal income tax but not from state income taxes.

(i) Any amount taken as a deduction under section 1341 of the Internal Revenue Code in computing federal taxable income for the tax year, if the taxpayer has claimed a credit for claim of right income repayment adjustment under ORS 315.068. (j) If the taxpayer makes a nonqualified withdrawal, as defined in ORS 178.300, from a savings network account for higher education established under ORS 178.300 to 178.360, the amount of the withdrawal that is attributable to contributions that were subtracted from federal taxable income under ORS 316.699.

      "text": "Additional modifications of taxable income; rules. (1) In addition to the modifications to federal taxable income contained in this chapter, there shall be added to or subtracted from federal taxable income: (a) If, in computing federal income tax for a tax year, the taxpayer deducted itemized deductions, as defined in section 63(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxpayer shall add the amount of itemized deductions deducted (the itemized deductions less an amount, if any, by which the itemized deductions are reduced under section 68 of the Internal Revenue Code). (b) If, in computing federal income tax for a tax year, the taxpayer deducted the standard deduction, as defined in section 63(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxpayer shall add the amount of the standard deduction deducted. (c)(A) From federal taxable income there shall be subtracted the larger of (i) the taxpayers itemized deductions or (ii) a standard deduction. Except as provided in subsection (8) of this section, for purposes of this subparagraph, standard deduction means the sum of the basic standard deduction and the additional standard deduction. (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the basic standard deduction is: (i) $3,280, in the case of joint return filers or a surviving spouse; (ii) $1,640, in the case of an individual who is not a married individual and is not a surviving spouse; (iii) $1,640, in the case of a married individual who files a separate return; or (iv) $2,640, in the case of a head of household. (C)(i) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2003, the Department of Revenue shall annually recompute the basic standard deduction for each category of return filer listed under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. The basic standard deduction shall be computed by dividing the monthly averaged U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for the 12 consecutive months ending August 31 of the prior calendar year by the average U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for the second quarter of 2002, then multiplying that quotient by the amount listed under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph for each category of return filer. (ii) If any change in the maximum household income determined under this subparagraph is not a multiple of $5, the increase shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $5. (iii) As used in this subparagraph, U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index means the U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (All Items) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. (D) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the additional standard deduction is the sum of each additional amount to which the taxpayer is entitled under subsection (7) of this section. (E) As used in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, surviving spouse and head of household have the meanings given those terms in section 2 of the Internal Revenue Code. (F) In the case of the following, the standard deduction referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be zero: (i) One of the spouses in a marriage filing a separate return where the other spouse has claimed itemized deductions under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; (ii) A nonresident noncitizen; (iii) An individual making a return for a period of less than 12 months on account of a change in the individuals annual accounting period; (iv) An estate or trust; (v) A common trust fund; or (vi) A partnership. (d) For the purposes of paragraph (c)(A) of this subsection, the taxpayers itemized deductions are the amount of the taxpayers itemized deductions as defined in section 63(d) of the Internal Revenue Code (reduced, if applicable, as described under section 68 of the Internal Revenue Code) minus the deduction for Oregon income tax (reduced, if applicable, by the proportion that the reduction in federal itemized deductions resulting from section 68 of the Internal Revenue Code bears to the amount of federal itemized deductions as defined for purposes of section 68 of the Internal Revenue Code). (2)(a) There shall be subtracted from federal taxable income any portion of the distribution of a pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus or other retirement plan, representing that portion of contributions which were taxed by the State of Oregon but not taxed by the federal government under laws in effect for tax years beginning prior to January 1, 1969, or for any subsequent year in which the amount that was contributed to the plan under the Internal Revenue Code was greater than the amount allowed under this chapter. (b) Interest or other earnings on any excess contributions of a pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus or other retirement plan not permitted to be deducted under paragraph (a) of this subsection may not be added to federal taxable income in the year earned by the plan and may not be subtracted from federal taxable income in the year received by the taxpayer. (3)(a) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, there shall be added to federal taxable income the amount of any federal income taxes in excess of the amount provided in paragraphs (b) to (d) of this subsection, accrued by the taxpayer during the tax year as described in ORS 316.685, less the amount of any refund of federal taxes previously accrued for which a tax benefit was received. (b) The limits applicable to this subsection are: (A) $5,500, if the federal adjusted gross income of the taxpayer for the tax year is less than $125,000, or, if reported on a joint return, less than $250,000. (B) $4,400, if the federal adjusted gross income of the taxpayer for the tax year is $125,000 or more and less than $130,000, or, if reported on a joint return, $250,000 or more and less than $260,000. (C) $3,300, if the federal adjusted gross income of the taxpayer for the tax year is $130,000 or more and less than $135,000, or, if reported on a joint return, $260,000 or more and less than $270,000.

(C) As used in this paragraph, U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index means the U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (All Items) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. (D) If any adjustment determined under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph is not a multiple of $50, the adjustment shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $50. (E) The adjustment shall apply to all tax years beginning in the calendar year for which the adjustment is made. (4)(a) In addition to the adjustments required by ORS 316.130, a full-year nonresident individual shall add to taxable income a proportion of any accrued federal income taxes as computed under ORS 316.685 in excess of the amount provided in subsection (3) of this section in the proportion provided in ORS 316.117. (b) In the case of spouses in a marriage filing separate tax returns, the amount added under this subsection shall be computed in a manner consistent with the computation of the amount to be added in the case of spouses in a marriage filing separate returns under subsection (3) of this section. The method of computation shall be determined by the Department of Revenue by rule. (5) Subsections (3)(d) and (4)(b) of this section shall not apply to married individuals living apart as defined in section 7703(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. (6)(a) For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 1981, and prior to January 1, 1983, income or loss taken into account in determining federal taxable income by a shareholder of an S corporation pursuant to sections 1373 to 1375 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be adjusted for purposes of determining Oregon taxable income, to the extent that as income or loss of the S corporation, they were required to be adjusted under the provisions of ORS chapter 317. (b) For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 1983, items of income, loss or deduction taken into account in determining federal taxable income by a shareholder of an S corporation pursuant to sections 1366 to 1368 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be adjusted for purposes of determining Oregon taxable income, to the extent that as items of income, loss or deduction of the shareholder the items are required to be adjusted under the provisions of this chapter. (c) The tax years referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection are those of the S corporation. (d) As used in paragraph (a) of this subsection, an S corporation refers to an electing small business corporation. (7)(a) The taxpayer shall be entitled to an additional amount, as referred to in subsection (1)(c)(A) and (D) of this section, of $1,000: (A) For the taxpayer if the taxpayer has attained age 65 before the close of the taxpayers tax year; and (B) For the spouse of the taxpayer if the spouse has attained age 65 before the close of the tax year and an additional exemption is allowable to the taxpayer for such spouse for federal income tax purposes under section 151(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. (b) The taxpayer shall be entitled to an additional amount, as referred to in subsection (1)(c)(A) and (D) of this section, of $1,000: (A) For the taxpayer if the taxpayer is blind at the close of the tax year; and (B) For the spouse of the taxpayer if the spouse is blind as of the close of the tax year and an additional exemption is allowable to the taxpayer for such spouse for federal income tax purposes under section 151(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of this subparagraph, if the spouse dies during the tax year, the determination of whether such spouse is blind shall be made immediately prior to death. (c) In the case of an individual who is not married and is not a surviving spouse, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection shall be applied by substituting $1,200 for $1,000. (d) For purposes of this subsection, an individual is blind only if the individuals central visual acuity does not exceed 20/200 in the better eye with correcting lenses, or if the individuals visual acuity is greater than 20/200 but is accompanied by a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees. (8) In the case of an individual with respect to whom a deduction under section 151 of the Internal Revenue Code is allowable for federal income tax purposes to another taxpayer for a tax year beginning in the calendar year in which the individuals tax year begins, the basic standard deduction (referred to in subsection (1)(c)(B) of this section) applicable to such individual for such individuals tax year shall equal the lesser of: (a) The amount allowed to the individual under section 63(c)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax purposes for the tax year for which the deduction is being claimed; or (b) The amount determined under subsection (1)(c)(B) of this section.

(2) A penalty may be imposed under subsection (1) of this section only if the conduct referred to in subsection (1) of this section is due to: (a) A position which is frivolous; or (b) An intention, apparent on the face of the purported return, to delay or impede the administration of the income tax laws of this state. (3) The penalty imposed under this section is in addition to any other penalty imposed by law. Any person against whom a penalty is assessed under this section may appeal to the tax court as provided in ORS 305.404 to 305.560. If the penalty is not paid within 10 days after the order of the tax court becomes final, the department may record the order and collect the amount assessed in the same manner as income tax deficiencies are recorded and collected under ORS 314.430. (4) If an assessment of tax due for the taxable year with respect to which a penalty is imposed under this section is under appeal at the same time that an appeal is filed under this subsection, the tax court may consolidate the appeals into a single proceeding. (5) As used in this section, a position which is frivolous includes, but is not limited to: (a) Reference to a spurious constitutional argument; (b) Reliance on a gold standard or war tax deduction; (c) An argument that wages or salary are not includable in taxable income; (d) An argument that the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was not properly adopted; or (e) An argument that unenfranchised, sovereign, freemen or natural persons are not subject to the tax laws.
