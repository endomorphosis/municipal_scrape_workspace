The depositors shall reimburse the State Treasurer for any expenses incurred by the treasurer in the mailing, insuring, shipping or delivering of any such securities, or of the interest coupons attached thereto as they mature.

ORS 825.605 does not apply to a commercial vehicle if it is necessary to idle the primary engine of the commercial vehicle: (1) Due to traffic, a traffic control device or mechanical difficulties over which the operator has no control or at the direction of a law enforcement official or road authority. (2) Due to the need to operate defrosters, heaters or air conditioners or installing equipment necessary to comply with manufacturers operating requirements, specifications and warranties or with federal, state or local safety regulations. (3) Because the commercial vehicle is a police, fire, ambulance, public safety, military, utility service or road authority vehicle, or any other vehicle being used to respond to an emergency or for other public safety purposes, or being actively used for training for emergencies or public safety. (4) For maintenance, service, repair or diagnostic purposes or for particulate matter trap regeneration. (5) For a state or federal inspection to verify that all equipment is in good working order. (6) To power work-related mechanical, safety, electrical or construction equipment installed on the vehicle that is not used for propulsion. (7) Because the commercial vehicle is an armored vehicle and a person must remain inside the vehicle to guard the contents or while the vehicle is being loaded or unloaded. (8) To maintain the comfort of commercial bus passengers while passengers are on board. (9) In a commercial vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 26,000 pounds, for purposes of air conditioning or heating during a rest or sleep period and the outside temperature is less than 50 degrees or greater than 75 degrees Fahrenheit at any time during the rest or sleep period. This subsection applies to a commercial vehicle with a sleeper berth compartment that is parked in any place that a commercial vehicle is legally permitted to park, including, but not limited to, a fleet trucking terminal, commercial vehicle stop or designated rest area. This exemption does not apply if the commercial vehicle is equipped with an auxiliary power unit or other suitable idle reduction technology, if the commercial vehicle is parked at a location equipped with suitable stationary idle reduction technology that is available for use, or during a rest or sleep period when the commercial vehicle is parked on or adjacent to a public or private educational institution offering education in all or part of kindergarten through grade 12, unless the outside temperature is greater than 75 degrees Fahrenheit and the auxiliary power unit provides heating only, in which case the person may idle the primary engine to provide air conditioning. (10) In a commercial vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 26,000 pounds, for purposes of air conditioning or heating while waiting to load or unload the commercial vehicle or while actually loading or unloading the commercial vehicle, and the outside temperature is less than 50 degrees or greater than 75 degrees Fahrenheit at the time. This exemption does not apply if the commercial vehicle is equipped with an auxiliary power unit or other suitable idle reduction technology, or if the commercial vehicle is parked at a location equipped with suitable stationary idle reduction technology that is available for use, unless the outside temperature is greater than 75 degrees Fahrenheit and the auxiliary power unit provides heating only, in which case the person may idle the primary engine to provide air conditioning.

(b) In addition to all other penalties provided by law, every person who violates or who procures, aids or abets in the violation of ORS 825.100 by offering to transport or transporting household goods without a certificate shall incur a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for every such violation. (2) Each violation described in this section is a separate offense and in case of a continuing violation every days continuance is a separate violation. Every act of commission or omission that procures, aids or abets in the violation is a violation under this section and subject to the civil penalty provided in this section. (3) Civil penalties under this section shall be imposed in the manner provided in ORS 183.745. (4) The Department of Transportation may reduce any civil penalty provided for in this section on such terms as the department considers proper if: (a) The defendant admits the violations alleged in the notice and makes timely request for reduction of the penalty; or (b) The defendant submits to the department a written request for reduction of the penalty within 15 days from the date the penalty order is served. (5) If the amount of such penalty is not paid to the department, the Attorney General, at the request of the department, shall bring an action in the name of the State of Oregon in the Circuit Court of Marion County to recover such penalty. The action may not be commenced until after the time has expired for an appeal from the findings, conclusions and order of the department. In all such actions the procedure and rules of evidence shall be the same as an ordinary civil action except as otherwise provided in this chapter. (6) Any motor carrier of household goods found knowingly to have assessed charges for transportation service less than published in its tariffs or written contracts on file with the department may be directed to collect the undercharges from the persons liable for the undercharges and to remit the undercharges to the department in addition to any monetary penalties imposed against the carrier for charging less than the tariff or contract prescribes. (7) Any motor carrier of household goods found to have assessed charges for transportation service more than the rates that have been legally filed with and prescribed by the department shall refund the overcharges to the persons from whom collected. If the carrier is unable to do so, the carrier may be required to remit such overcharges to the department in addition to any monetary penalties imposed against the carrier for charging more than the applicable tariff or contract prescribes.",
