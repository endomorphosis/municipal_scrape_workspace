      "text": "Policy. The Legislative Assembly finds that continuing care retirement communities are an important and necessary alternative for the long term residential, social and health maintenance needs for many of Oregons senior citizens. The Legislative Assembly recognizes the need for disclosure with respect to the terms of agreements between residents, prospective residents and the provider. The Legislative Assembly also recognizes the need to establish reserves and escrow requirements to provide adequate standards for the development and operation of continuing care retirement communities. Accordingly, the Legislative Assembly has determined that these providers should be registered and should establish reserves and escrows in accordance with this chapter.",
