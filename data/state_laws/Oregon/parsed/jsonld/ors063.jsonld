(1) The only fiduciary duties a member owes to a member-managed limited liability company and its other members are the duty of loyalty and the duty of care set forth in subsections (2) and (3) of this section. (2) A members duty of loyalty to a member-managed limited liability company and its other members includes the following: (a) To account to the limited liability company and hold for it any property, profit or benefit derived by the member in the conduct and winding up of the limited liability companys business or derived from a use by the member of limited liability company property, including the appropriation of a limited liability company opportunity; (b) Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section, to refrain from dealing with the limited liability company in a manner adverse to the limited liability company and to refrain from representing a person with an interest adverse to the limited liability company, in the conduct or winding up of the limited liability companys business; and (c) To refrain from competing with the limited liability company in the conduct of the business of the limited liability company before the dissolution of the limited liability company. (3) A members duty of care to a member-managed limited liability company and the other members in the conduct and winding up of the business of the limited liability company is limited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law. (4) A member shall discharge the duties to a member-managed limited liability company and the other members under this chapter or under any operating agreement of the limited liability company and exercise any rights consistent with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing. (5) A member of a member-managed limited liability company does not violate a duty or obligation under this chapter or under any operating agreement of the limited liability company merely because the members conduct furthers the members own interest. (6) A member of a member-managed limited liability company may lend money to or transact other business with the limited liability company, provided that any loan or transaction between the member and the limited liability company must be: (a) Fair to the limited liability company; (b) Authorized by an operating agreement; or (c) Authorized or ratified by a majority of the disinterested members or by a number or percentage of members specified in the operating agreement after full disclosure of all material facts. (7) Loans and other transactions between a member-managed limited liability company and a member are binding on the parties in the same manner as transactions between the limited liability company and persons who are not members, subject to other applicable law. (8) This section also applies to a person who is not a member and who is winding up the limited liability companys business. (9) In a manager-managed limited liability company: (a) A member who is not also a manager owes no duties to the limited liability company or the other members solely by reason of being a member; (b) A manager is held to the same standards of conduct prescribed for members in subsections (2) to (8) of this section; (c) A member who, pursuant to an operating agreement, exercises some or all of the rights of a manager in the management and conduct of the limited liability companys business is held to the standards of conduct described in subsections (2) to (8) of this section to the extent that the member exercises the managerial authority vested in a manager by this chapter; and (d) A manager is relieved of liability imposed by law for violation of the standards prescribed by this section to the extent, if any, of the managerial authority delegated to the members who are not also managers by an operating agreement. (10) The articles of organization or an operating agreement of a limited liability company may not: (a) Eliminate completely the duty of loyalty under subsection (2) of this section, but the articles of organization or an operating agreement may: (A) Identify specific types or categories of activities that do not violate the duty of loyalty, if not unconscionable; and (B) Specify the number or percentage of members, whether interested or disinterested, or disinterested managers that may authorize or ratify, after full disclosure of all material facts, a specific act or transaction that otherwise would violate the duty of loyalty. (b) Unreasonably reduce the duty of care under subsection (3) of this section. (c) Eliminate completely the obligation of good faith and fair dealing under subsection (4) of this section, but the articles of organization or an operating agreement may determine the standards by which performance of the obligation of good faith and fair dealing is to be measured, if the standards are not unconscionable. (11) For the purposes of subsection (10)(a) of this section, specific types or categories of activities that may be identified as not violating the duty of loyalty include, but are not limited to: (a) Competing with the limited liability company in the conduct of the business of the limited liability company before the dissolution of the limited liability company; and (b) Entering into or engaging in, for a members own account, an investment, business, transaction or activity that is similar to the investments, businesses, transactions or activities of the limited liability company without: (A) First offering the limited liability company or the other members an opportunity to participate in the investment, business, transaction or activity; or (B) Having any obligation to account to the limited liability company or the other members for the investment, business, transaction or activity or the profits from the investment, business, transaction or activity.",

(2) The members or managers of a limited liability company may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (1) of this section either on: (a) Financial statements that the members or managers reasonably believe have been prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances; or (b) A fair valuation or other method that the members or managers reasonably believe is reasonable in the circumstances. (3) For purposes of this section, the amount, if any, by which a liability as to which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the limited liability company exceeds the fair value of such specific property shall be disregarded as a liability of the limited liability company. (4) The effect of a distribution under subsection (1) of this section is measured for purposes of this section: (a) In the case of distribution by purchase, retirement or other acquisition of all or a portion of a members interest in the limited liability company, as of the earlier of the date the money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the limited liability company or the date the member ceases to be a member with respect to the membership interest purchased, retired or otherwise acquired; (b) In the case of any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the date the indebtedness is distributed; and (c) In all other cases, as of the date a distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within 120 days after the date of authorization or the date the payment is made if it occurs more than 120 days after the date of authorization. (5) A limited liability companys indebtedness to a member incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the limited liability companys indebtedness to its general unsecured creditors, unless the member agrees to subordination or the limited liability company grants the member a security interest or other lien against limited liability company assets to secure the indebtedness.",

For purposes of this subparagraph: (i) A court may find that a limited liability company is a shell entity if the court determines that the limited liability company was used or organized for an illegal purpose, was used or organized to defraud or deceive a person or a governmental agency or was used or organized to fraudulently conceal any business activity from another person or a governmental agency; and (ii) The Attorney General may make a prima facie showing that a limited liability company is a shell entity by stating in an affidavit that: (I) The limited liability company did not provide a name or address required by the Secretary of State, or the name or address the limited liability company provided was false, fraudulent or inadequate; (II) The limited liability companys articles of organization, a record the limited liability company must keep under ORS 63.771 or the limited liability companys annual report is false, fraudulent or inadequate; (III) A public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, attempted to communicate with, or serve legal process upon, the limited liability company at the address or by means of other contact information the limited liability company provided to the Secretary of State, but the limited liability company failed to respond; or (IV) The Attorney General has other evidence that shows that the limited liability company was used or organized for an illegal purpose, was used or organized to defraud or deceive a person or a governmental agency or was used or organized to fraudulently conceal any business activity from another person or a governmental agency. (b) In a proceeding by or for a member if the court finds that it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the business of the limited liability company in conformance with the articles of organization or any operating agreement. (c) In a proceeding by the limited liability company to have the limited liability companys voluntary dissolution continued under court supervision. (2) In addition to subjecting a limited liability company to dissolution under subsection (1)(a)(C) of this section, a finding that a limited liability company is a shell entity has the following effects: (a) A court may rebuttably presume that the limited liability companys filings with the Secretary of State constitute a false claim, as defined in ORS 180.750, in any action the Attorney General brings against the limited liability company under ORS 180.760 and may award to the Attorney General reasonable attorney fees and the costs of investigation, preparation and litigation if the Attorney General prevails in the action; and (b) A public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, in any proceeding against the limited liability company, may move to enjoin a member, manager or other person that exercises significant direction or control over the limited liability company from engaging in commercial activity in this state, including but not limited to incorporating or organizing another entity in this state. (3) A limited liability company may affirmatively defend against an allegation that the limited liability company is a shell entity by showing that the limited liability company, within 60 days after receiving a request to provide or correct a name, address or other information required for a filing or in articles of organization, a record the limited liability company must keep or an annual report, or within 60 days after the date of a request to respond to a communication or service of process, provided or corrected the name, address or other information or responded to the communication or service of process.",
