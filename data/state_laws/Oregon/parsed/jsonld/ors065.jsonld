A corporation sole that exists before June 8, 2015, may continue to operate as a corporation sole, subject to the provisions of this chapter, if the corporation sole remains active and was not dissolved.

(2) A transaction in which a director of a public benefit corporation or religious corporation has a conflict of interest may be approved: (a) By the vote of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors if the material facts of the transaction and the directors interest are disclosed or known to the board of directors or committee of the board of directors; or (b) By obtaining approval of: (A) The Attorney General; or (B) The circuit court in an action in which the Attorney General is joined as a party. (3) A transaction in which a director of a mutual benefit corporation has a conflict of interest may be approved: (a) In advance by the vote of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors if the material facts of the transaction and the directors interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors; or (b) If the material facts of the transaction and the directors interest were disclosed or known to the members and the members authorized, approved or ratified the transaction. (4) For the purposes of this section, a director of the corporation has an indirect interest in a transaction if: (a) Another entity in which the director has a material interest or in which the director is a general partner is a party to the transaction; (b) Another entity of which the director is a director, officer or trustee is a party to the transaction, and the transaction is or should be considered by the board of directors of the corporation; or (c) A person who is related to the director or a business associate of the director is a party to the transaction. (5) For purposes of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if the transaction receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board of directors or on the committee who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction. A transaction may not be authorized, approved or ratified under this section by a single director. If a majority of the directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction votes to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under subsection (2)(a) or (3)(a) of this section if the transaction is otherwise approved as provided in subsection (2) or (3) of this section. (6) For purposes of subsection (3)(b) of this section, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified by the members if the transaction receives a majority of the votes entitled to be counted under this subsection. Votes cast by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and votes cast by or voted under the control of an entity described in subsection (4) of this section may be counted in a vote of members to determine whether to authorize, approve or ratify a conflict of interest transaction under subsection (3)(b) of this section. A majority of the members, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section. (7) The articles of incorporation, bylaws or a resolution of the board may impose additional requirements on conflict of interest transactions.",

      "text": "Grounds for judicial dissolution. (1) A circuit court may dissolve a corporation: (a) In a proceeding by the Attorney General if the court finds that: (A) The corporation filed articles of incorporation with fraudulent intent, with fraudulent information or in a manner that otherwise indicates fraud; (B) The corporation has exceeded or abused the authority conferred upon the corporation by law; (C) The corporation has fraudulently solicited money or has fraudulently used the money solicited; (D) The corporation is a public benefit corporation and the corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted; (E) The corporation is a public benefit corporation and is no longer able to carry out the public benefit corporations purposes or the Internal Revenue Service has revoked the public benefit corporations tax exempt status; or (F) The corporation is a shell entity. For purposes of this subparagraph: (i) A court may find that a corporation is a shell entity if the court determines that the corporation was used or incorporated for an illegal purpose, was used or incorporated to defraud or deceive a person or a governmental agency or was used or incorporated to fraudulently conceal any business activity from another person or a governmental agency; and (ii) The Attorney General may make a prima facie showing that a corporation is a shell entity by stating in an affidavit that: (I) The corporation did not provide a name or address required by the Secretary of State, or the name or address the corporation provided was false, fraudulent or inadequate; (II) The corporations articles of incorporation, a record the corporation must keep under ORS 65.771 or the corporations annual report is false, fraudulent or inadequate; (III) A public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, attempted to communicate with, or serve legal process upon, the corporation at the address or by means of other contract information the corporation provided to the Secretary of State, but the corporation failed to respond; or (IV) The Attorney General has other evidence that shows that the corporation was used or incorporated for an illegal purpose, was used or incorporated to defraud or deceive a person or a governmental agency or was used or incorporated to fraudulently conceal any business activity from another person or a governmental agency. (b) Except as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of a religious corporation, in a proceeding by 50 members or members holding five percent or more of the voting power, whichever is less, or by a director or any person specified in the articles of incorporation, if the court finds that: (A) The directors are deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs, and the members, if any, are unable to break the deadlock; (B) The directors or those in control of the corporation have acted, are acting or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive or fraudulent; (C) The members are deadlocked in voting power and have failed, for a period that includes at least two consecutive annual meeting dates, to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired; (D) The corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted; or (E) The corporation is a public benefit corporation or religious corporation and is no longer able to carry out the public benefit corporations or religious corporations purposes; (c) In a proceeding by a creditor if the court finds that: (A) The creditors claim has been reduced to judgment, the execution on the judgment has been returned unsatisfied and the corporation is insolvent; or (B) The corporation has admitted in writing that the creditors claim is due and owing and the corporation is insolvent; or (d) In a proceeding by the corporation to have the corporations voluntary dissolution continued under court supervision. (2) Before dissolving a corporation, the court shall consider whether: (a) Reasonable alternatives to dissolution exist; (b) Dissolution is in the public interest, if the corporation is a public benefit corporation; or (c) Dissolution is the best way of protecting the interests of members, if the corporation is a mutual benefit corporation. (3) In addition to subjecting a corporation to dissolution under subsection (1)(a)(F) of this section, a finding that a corporation is a shell entity has the following effects: (a) A court may rebuttably presume that the corporations filings with the Secretary of State constitute a false claim, as defined in ORS 180.750, in any action the Attorney General brings against the corporation under ORS 180.760 and may award to the Attorney General reasonable attorney fees and the costs of investigation, preparation and litigation if the Attorney General prevails in the action; and (b) A public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, in any proceeding against the corporation, may move to enjoin a director, officer or other person that exercises significant direction or control over the corporation from engaging in commercial activity in this state, including but not limited to incorporating or organizing an entity in this state. (4) A corporation may affirmatively defend against an allegation that the corporation is a shell entity by showing that the corporation, within 60 days after receiving a request to provide or correct a name, address or other information required for a filing or in articles of incorporation, a record the corporation must keep or an annual report, or within 60 days after the date of a request to respond to a communication or service of process, provided or corrected the name, address or other information or responded to the communication or service of process.",

      "text": "Grounds for judicial revocation. (1) A circuit court may revoke the authority of a foreign corporation to transact business in this state: (a) In a proceeding by the Attorney General if the court finds that: (A) The foreign corporation obtained authority to transact business in this state with fraudulent intent, with fraudulent information or in a manner that otherwise indicates fraud; (B) The foreign corporation has exceeded or abused the authority conferred upon the foreign corporation by law; (C) The foreign corporation would have been a public benefit corporation had the foreign corporation been incorporated in this state and the foreign corporations corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted; (D) The foreign corporation would have been a public benefit corporation had the foreign corporation been incorporated in this state and the foreign corporation is no longer able to carry out the foreign corporations purposes; (E) An incorporator, director, officer or agent of the foreign corporation signed a document knowing that the document was false in any material respect with the intent that the document be delivered to the Secretary of State for filing; (F) The foreign corporation has fraudulently solicited money or has fraudulently used the money solicited; or (G) The foreign corporation is a shell entity. For purposes of this subparagraph: (i) A court may find that a foreign corporation is a shell entity if the court determines that the foreign corporation was used or incorporated for an illegal purpose, was used or incorporated to defraud or deceive a person or governmental agency or was used or incorporated to fraudulently conceal any business activity from another person or a governmental agency; and (ii) The Attorney General may make a prima facie showing that a foreign corporation is a shell entity by stating in an affidavit that: (I) The foreign corporation did not provide a name or address required by the Secretary of State, or the name or address the foreign corporation provided was false, fraudulent or inadequate; (II) The foreign corporations application for authority to transact business in this state, a record the foreign corporation must keep under ORS 65.771 or the foreign corporations annual report is false, fraudulent or inadequate; (III) A public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, attempted to communicate with, or serve legal process upon, the foreign corporation at the address or by means of other contact information the foreign corporation provided to the Secretary of State, but the foreign corporation failed to respond; or (IV) The Attorney General has other evidence that shows that the foreign corporation was used or incorporated for an illegal purpose, was used or incorporated to defraud or deceive a person or a governmental agency or was used or incorporated to fraudulently conceal any business activity from another person or governmental agency. (b) Except as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of a foreign corporation that would have been a religious corporation had the foreign corporation been incorporated in this state, in a proceeding by 50 members or members holding five percent or more of the voting power, whichever is less, or by a director or any person specified in the articles of incorporation, if the court finds that: (A) The directors are deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs, and the members, if any, are unable to break the deadlock; (B) The directors or those in control of the foreign corporation have acted, are acting, or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive or fraudulent; (C) The members are deadlocked in voting power and have failed, for a period that includes at least two consecutive annual meeting dates, to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired; (D) The corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted; or (E) The foreign corporation would have been a public benefit corporation or religious corporation had the foreign corporation been incorporated in this state, and is no longer able to carry out the foreign corporations purposes. (c) In a proceeding by a creditor if the court finds that: (A) The creditors claim has been reduced to judgment, the execution on the judgment returned unsatisfied and the foreign corporation is insolvent; or (B) The foreign corporation has admitted in writing that the creditors claim is due and owing and the foreign corporation is insolvent. (2) Before revoking a foreign corporations authority, the court shall consider whether: (a) Reasonable alternatives to revocation of authority exist; (b) Revocation of authority is in the public interest, if the foreign corporation would have been a public benefit corporation had the foreign corporation been incorporated in this state; or (c) Revocation of authority is the best way to protect the interests of members, if the foreign corporation would have been a mutual benefit corporation had the foreign corporation been incorporated in this state. (3) In addition to subjecting a foreign corporation to revocation of the foreign corporations authority to transact business in this state under subsection (1)(a)(G) of this section, a finding that a foreign corporation is a shell entity has the following effects: (a) A court may rebuttably presume that the foreign corporations filings with the Secretary of State constitute a false claim, as defined in ORS 180.750, in any action the Attorney General brings under ORS 180.760 and may award to the Attorney General reasonable attorney fees and the costs of investigation, preparation and litigation if the Attorney General prevails in the action; and (b) A public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, in any proceeding against the foreign corporation, may move to enjoin a director, officer or other person that exercises significant direction or control over the foreign corporation from engaging in commercial activity in this state including, but not limited to, incorporating or organizing an entity in this state. (4) A foreign corporation may affirmatively defend against an allegation that the foreign corporation is a shell entity by showing that the foreign corporation, within 60 days after receiving a request to provide or correct a name, address or other information required for a filing or in an application for authority to transact business in this state, a record the foreign corporation must keep or an annual report, or within 60 days after the date of a request to respond to a communication or service of process, provided or corrected the name, address or other information or responded to the communication or service of process.",
