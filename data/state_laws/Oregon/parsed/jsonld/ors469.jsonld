      "text": "Policy. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that: (1) Continued growth in demand for nonrenewable energy forms poses a serious and immediate, as well as future, problem. It is essential that future generations not be left a legacy of vanished or depleted resources, resulting in massive environmental, social and financial impact. (2) It is the goal of Oregon to promote the efficient use of energy resources and to develop permanently sustainable energy resources. The need exists for comprehensive state leadership in energy production, distribution and utilization. It is, therefore, the policy of Oregon: (a) That development and use of a diverse array of permanently sustainable energy resources be encouraged utilizing to the highest degree possible the private sector of our free enterprise system. (b) That through state government example and other effective communications, energy conservation and elimination of wasteful and uneconomical uses of energy and materials be promoted. This conservation must include, but not be limited to, resource recovery and materials recycling. (c) That the basic human needs of every citizen, present and future, shall be given priority in the allocation of energy resources, commensurate with perpetuation of a free and productive economy with special attention to the preservation and enhancement of environmental quality. (d) That state government assist every citizen and industry in adjusting to a diminished availability of energy. (e) That energy-efficient modes of transportation for people and goods shall be encouraged, while energy-inefficient modes of transportation shall be discouraged. (f) That cost-effectiveness be considered in state agency decision-making relating to energy sources, facilities or conservation, and that cost-effectiveness be considered in all agency decision-making relating to energy facilities. (g) That state government shall provide a source of impartial and objective information in order that this energy policy may be enhanced.",

(2) To the extent consistent with the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 6326, the energy security plan must align with strategies in the Oregon Fuel Action Plan developed by the department and must include, but need not be limited to: (a) An evaluation of the states ability to recover quickly from physical threats, including a magnitude 9.0 Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake, and cybersecurity threats. (b) Recommendations for increasing the geographic diversity of fuel storage capacity throughout this state. (c) An assessment of the seismic resilience of existing fuel storage facilities throughout this state. (d) Consistent with state programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation fuels, an assessment of the use of renewable fuels and other innovative alternatives to improve disaster resilience. (e) An evaluation of strategies for mitigating barriers to implementing a geographically distributed fuel network throughout this state, including: (A) Adoption of Oregon Fuel Action Plan criteria for predesignated fuel points of distribution for receiving emergency fuel supplies at selected fuel diversification sites. (B) Strategies for expanding storage capacities at public facilities with existing capability to store and dispense unleaded, diesel or aviation fuel, including an evaluation of whether fuel storage sites contain properly installed seismically certified generators and adequate on-site fuel storage capacity to power backup generators so that independent operations can be maintained for three or more weeks after a Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake. (C) Partnerships with private-sector companies to build fuel storage capacity at identified, prioritized locations, especially private-sector companies that provide an emergency or essential service mission to save or sustain life or support the restoration of critical lifelines and services in support of the states overall response and recovery effort. (D) Strategies for increasing geographically distributed fuel storage that prioritize areas of this state that are expected to be most vulnerable to a Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake, including local or regional islanding effects that would isolate a region from the rest of this state as a result of road or bridge damage. (E) An evaluation of potential impacts to communities adjacent to potential locations for emergency fuel storage or expanded fuel storage, including consultation and outreach with those communities. (3) In developing and implementing the energy security plan, the department shall consult with: (a) Relevant state government agencies, including the Public Utility Commission, the Department of Environmental Quality, the Department of Transportation, the Oregon Department of Aviation, the Oregon Department of Emergency Management, the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries and the Environmental Justice Council; (b) Local governments; (c) Tribal governments; (d) Consumer-owned and investor-owned electric utilities; (e) Natural gas utilities; (f) Fuel suppliers; (g) Qualified technical experts in disaster resilience; and (h) Any other person with relevant knowledge or experience. (4) No later than September 15 of each even-numbered year, the State Department of Energy shall provide to the interim committees of the Legislative Assembly related to energy a report in the manner provided under ORS 192.245 describing the implementation or revision of the energy security plan developed under this section.

(1) The State Department of Energy shall periodically review the minimum energy efficiency standards specified in ORS 469.233. (2)(a) After the review pursuant to subsection (1) of this section and notwithstanding ORS 469.233, the Director of the State Department of Energy may adopt rules to update the minimum energy efficiency standards specified in ORS 469.233 if the director determines that the standards need to be updated: (A) To promote energy conservation in the state; (B) To achieve cost-effectiveness for consumers; or (C) Due to federal action or to the outcome of collaborative consultations with manufacturers and the energy departments of other states. (b)(A) In addition to the rules adopted under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the director may postpone by rule the operative date of any of the minimum energy efficiency standards specified in ORS 469.233 if the director determines that: (i) Adjoining states with similar minimum energy efficiency standards have postponed the operative date of their corresponding minimum energy efficiency standards; or (ii) Failure to modify the operative date of any of the minimum energy efficiency standards would impose a substantial hardship on manufacturers, retailers or the public. (B)(i) The director may not postpone the operative date of a minimum energy efficiency standard under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for more than one year. (ii) If at the end of the first postponement period the director determines that adjoining states have further postponed the operative date of minimum energy efficiency standards and the requirements of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph continue to be met, the director may postpone the operative date for not more than one additional year. (c) After the review pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the director may adopt rules to establish new minimum energy efficiency standards if the director determines that new standards are needed: (A) To promote energy conservation in the state; (B) To achieve cost-effectiveness for consumers; or (C) Due to federal action or to the outcome of collaborative consultations with manufacturers and the energy departments of other states. (d) If the director adopts rules under paragraph (a) of this subsection to update the minimum energy efficiency standards specified in ORS 469.233 or under paragraph (c) of this subsection to establish new minimum energy efficiency standards: (A) The rules may not take effect until one year following their adoption by the director; and (B) The Governor shall cause to be introduced at the next Legislative Assembly a bill to conform the statutory minimum energy efficiency standards to the minimum energy efficiency standards adopted by the director by rule. (3) Notwithstanding ORS 469.229 and 469.233 and the requirements of subsection (2) of this section, and after consultation with the appropriate advisory boards to the Department of Consumer and Business Services, the director may adopt rules to update the minimum energy efficiency standards or test methods specified in ORS 469.233 to a more recent version, including any product definitions associated with the standard or test method, if the director determines that the standard or test method needs to be updated to maintain or improve consistency with other comparable standards in other states. Rules adopted under this subsection shall take effect on or after the effective date of a similar standard or test method adopted by another state. (4) If the director determines that implementation of a state minimum energy efficiency standard requires a waiver of federal preemption, the director shall apply for a waiver of federal preemption pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6297(d).

      "text": "Definitions for ORS 469.275 to 469.291. As used in ORS 469.275 to 469.291: (1)(a) Agricultural building means a structure that is used for: (A) Storing, maintaining or repairing farm or forestry machinery and equipment; (B) Raising, harvesting and selling crops or forest products; (C) Feeding, breeding, managing and selling livestock, poultry, fur-bearing animals or honeybees or the produce of livestock, poultry, fur-bearing animals or honeybees; (D) Dairying and selling dairy products; or (E) Any other agricultural, forestry or horticultural use or animal husbandry, or any combination of agricultural, horticultural or animal husbandry uses, including preparing and storing produce raised on the farm for human use and animal use, preparing, processing and storing agricultural and forestry products and goods and disposing, by marketing or otherwise, of farm produce or forest products. (b) Agricultural building does not include: (A) A dwelling; (B) A structure used for a purpose other than growing plants in which 10 or more persons are present at any one time; (C) A structure regulated by the State Fire Marshal pursuant to ORS chapter 476; (D) A structure used by the public; or (E) A structure that is subject to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C 4001 to 4127), as amended, and regulations promulgated under that Act. (2) Conditional compliance means a temporary method that a building owner can use to demonstrate that the building owner has implemented required energy use reduction strategies when the building owner cannot demonstrate full compliance with a required energy use intensity target. (3) Covered commercial building means a tier 1 building or a tier 2 building. (4) Eligible building owner means: (a) An owner of a tier 1 building that must comply with the standard established in ORS 469.277; or (b) An owner of a tier 2 building. (5) Energy means: (a) Electricity, including electricity that is delivered through the electric grid and electricity that is generated at a building site using solar or wind energy resources; (b) Natural gas; (c) Steam, hot water or chilled water used for heating or cooling; (d) Propane; (e) Fuel oil; (f) Wood; (g) Coal; or (h) Any other fuel that meets a covered commercial buildings energy load. (6) Energy use intensity means a measurement that weather normalizes a buildings site energy use relative to the buildings size, calculated by dividing the total net energy the building consumes in one year by the buildings gross floor area, excluding any parking garage, and that is reported in thousands of British thermal units per square foot per year. (7) Energy use intensity target means a net energy use intensity that complies with the standard set forth in ORS 469.277. (8) Greenhouse gas has the meaning given that term in ORS 468A.210. (9)(a) Gross floor area means the total number of square feet of a building, measured from the exterior surfaces of a buildings fixed enclosing walls, including all floor space used as offices, lobbies, restrooms, equipment storage areas, mechanical rooms, break rooms and elevator shafts. (b) Gross floor area does not include bays or docks outside the building. (10) Net energy use means the sum of metered and bulk fuel energy that enters a building, minus the sum of metered energy that leaves the building. (11) Savings to investment ratio means the ratio of the total present value of savings to the total present value of costs to implement an energy conservation measure or water conservation measure, in which the numerator of the ratio is the present value of net savings in energy or water or in maintenance costs not related to fuel use or water use that are attributable to the energy conservation measure or water conservation measure and the denominator of the ratio is the present value of the net increase in investment and replacement costs, less the salvage value, of the energy conservation or water conservation measure. (12) Semiheated space means an enclosed space within a covered commercial building that is heated by a heating system with an output the Department of Consumer and Business Services specifies in an applicable specialty code. (13) Tier 1 building means a building in which the sum of gross floor area for hotel, motel and nonresidential use equals or exceeds 35,000 square feet, excluding any parking garage. (14)(a) Tier 2 building means: (A) A building with gross floor area, excluding any parking garage, that equals or exceeds 35,000 square feet and that is used as a multifamily residential building, a hospital, a school, a dormitory or a university building; or (B) A building in which the sum of gross floor area for hotel, motel and nonresidential use exceeds 20,000 square feet but does not exceed 35,000 square feet, excluding any parking garage. (b) Tier 2 building does not include a covered commercial building that is classified as a tier 1 building. (15) Unconditioned space means an enclosed space within a covered commercial building that is not: (a) Heated by a heating system or cooled by a cooling system with output capacities the Department of Consumer and Business Services specifies in an applicable specialty code; or (b) Indirectly heated or cooled in accordance with standards the department specifies in an applicable specialty code. (16) Weather normalized means a method for modifying a buildings energy use intensity in a specific year to account for deviations from the buildings energy use intensity as the energy use intensity ordinarily occurs during a year in which the weather does not fluctuate substantially or vary as a consequence of extreme weather events.

(1)(a) Not later than December 31, 2024, the State Department of Energy, in consultation with the Department of Consumer and Business Services, shall adopt rules that use the American National Standards Institutes standards for Energy Efficiency in Existing Buildings (ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 100) as an initial model for specifying an energy performance standard for covered commercial buildings. In rulemaking proceedings to adopt or update rules under this paragraph, the State Department of Energy shall disclose the sources of information, including the model described in this paragraph and any peer-reviewed science, that the department relies on in developing or updating the energy performance standard. The department shall update the energy performance standard not later than July 1, 2029, and by the same month and day in each successive period of five years. (b) The energy performance standard described in paragraph (a) of this subsection must: (A) Comply with the requirements of ORS 469.275 to 469.279; (B) Seek to maximize reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from covered commercial buildings; (C) Include energy use intensity targets that apply to specific types of buildings; and (D) Provide for methods to achieve conditional compliance with an applicable energy use intensity target, which must, at a minimum, require: (i) Preparing an energy management plan; (ii) Developing a program for building operations and maintenance that aims at achieving the applicable energy use intensity target; (iii) Making investments in energy use efficiency measures that aim at achieving the applicable energy use intensity target; and (iv) Submitting to energy use audits, which may be based upon or linked to ASHRAE Standard 211 audits. (c) Adoption of the energy performance standard described in paragraph (a) of this subsection does not change eligibility criteria for, or benefits or incentives available under, other programs for energy efficiency demand response. (2)(a) In adopting the energy performance standard described in subsection (1) of this section, the department: (A) Shall: (i) Develop energy use intensity targets that are not more stringent than the average energy use intensity for each covered commercial building occupancy classification, adjusting as necessary for a covered commercial buildings unique energy-using features; (ii) Consider, for the purpose of establishing energy use intensity targets, regional and local data that identifies building energy use, such as existing benchmarking data from the Energy Star program established under 42 U.S.C. 6294a; (iii) Consider, for the purpose of establishing the energy performance standard, federal and local programs that relate to energy efficiency standards, aligning where possible requirements under the energy performance standard to avoid duplicative work by regulators and eligible building owners; (iv) Develop energy use intensity targets for two or more climate zones that represent energy use in a year with normal weather; (v) Develop energy use intensity targets that exclude energy delivered through electric vehicle supply equipment; and (vi) Adopt a conditional compliance method that: (I) Requires eligible building owners of covered commercial buildings that do not meet an energy use intensity target to take action to reduce energy use; and (II) Specifies investment criteria that meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this subsection and that ensure progress toward meeting the energy use intensity target; and (B) May: (i) Consider building occupancy classifications set forth in ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 100 and the United States Environmental Protection Agencys Energy Star portfolio manager; (ii) Base energy use intensity targets for recently constructed covered commercial buildings on statewide energy codes that were in effect at the time the covered commercial building was constructed; and (iii) Require utilities, eligible building owners and other entities to aggregate data for covered commercial buildings that have multiple meters and to report or, as appropriate, provide the aggregated data for reports under ORS 469.279. (b)(A) Investment criteria the department specifies as part of a conditional compliance method under paragraph (a) of this subsection must: (i) Ensure that an eligible building owner meets the covered commercial buildings energy use intensity target by implementing energy efficiency measures identified in energy use audits; and (ii) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, require an eligible building owner to implement an optimized bundle of energy efficiency measures that provide maximum energy savings without resulting in a savings to investment ratio of less than 1.0 or require the eligible building owner to achieve the energy use intensity target by means of an implementation plan that: (I) Is based on an energy use audit and life-cycle cost analysis from ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 211 that accounts for the period during which a bundle of energy efficiency measures provide savings; (II) Reflects the eligible building owners net costs of implementing energy efficiency measures, excluding any costs that utility or government grants cover; (III) Allows an exclusion of energy efficiency measures that do not pay back the cost of the energy efficiency measure over the useful life of the energy efficiency measure; (IV) Allows an exclusion of energy efficiency measures that are excluded under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph; and (V) Allows for phased implementation in which an eligible building owner need not replace a system or equipment before the useful life of the system or equipment ends. (B) An eligible building owner need not meet an energy efficiency requirement that would compromise the historical integrity of a covered commercial building or part of a covered commercial building that: (i) Is listed on a state or national register of historic places; (ii) Is designated as an historic property under a state or local statute, ordinance, rule or other legislative act or a survey conducted under a statute, ordinance, rule or other legislative act; (iii) Is certified as a contributing resource within a historic district that is listed on a national register or is locally designated as a historic district; or (iv) A state historic preservation officer or the keeper of the national register of historic places has determined in an opinion or certification is eligible to be listed on the national or state register of historic places either as an individual building or as a building that contributes to a historic district.

      "text": "Incentive program for early and voluntary implementation of standards; application process; rules. (1) The State Department of Energy by rule shall establish a program to pay incentives to eligible building owners that implement ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 100 or the energy performance standard described in ORS 469.277 for covered commercial buildings before adoption and implementation is mandatory. The program must provide for: (a) An application process; (b) Standards by which the department may qualify an eligible building owner to receive, or disqualify an eligible building owner from receiving, an incentive payment; (c) A method for verifying a covered commercial buildings energy consumption with the eligible building owner and the electric utility, gas company or thermal energy company that supplies energy to the covered commercial building for the purpose of qualifying the eligible building owner to receive an incentive payment; (d) A process for calculating the amount of any incentive payment; (e) An administrative process by which an eligible building owner may appeal the departments decision to qualify or disqualify the eligible building owner or the departments determination of the amount of an incentive payment; and (f) A process for authorizing incentive payments and notifying eligible building owners and persons that administer incentive payments of the departments authorization. (2) To qualify for an incentive payment, an eligible building owner must report to the department in accordance with ORS 469.279 by the deadlines and for a period of time the department specifies by rule. In addition: (a) The eligible building owner must own a tier 1 building that is or will become subject to the requirements of ORS 469.275 to 469.279 or must own a tier 2 building that qualifies as provided in subsection (3) of this section; (b) If the covered commercial building is a tier 1 building, the tier 1 building must have a baseline energy use intensity that exceeds an applicable energy use intensity target by at least 15 energy use intensity units; and (c) The eligible building owner must comply with any other requirements the department specifies by rule. (3) An eligible building owner of a tier 2 building may receive an incentive payment of 35 cents per square foot of gross floor area, excluding any parking garage, unconditioned space or semiheated space if the eligible building owner has submitted to the department, or has agreed to submit to the department in advance of an established deadline, the data described in ORS 469.287. (4)(a) Subject to paragraph (c) of this subsection, an eligible building owner that applies and qualifies for an incentive payment under subsection (2) or (3) of this section may receive for meeting the energy performance standard described in ORS 469.277 early or voluntarily an incentive payment of 85 cents per square foot of gross floor area of the eligible building owners covered commercial building, excluding any parking garage, unconditioned space or semiheated space. (b) The department may authorize additional incentive payments to an eligible building owner that owns a tier 2 multifamily residential building and that enters into a binding agreement not to displace tenants from the multifamily residential building. (c) The department may authorize an incentive payment only if funds are available for the payment and contingent upon an eligible building owners compliance with the requirements of this section and any rules the department adopts to govern incentive payments. (5) Before qualifying an eligible building owner to receive an incentive payment under this section, the department shall review the eligible building owners application and verify any report the eligible building owner must provide under ORS 469.279 and any energy consumption the department must measure for the purposes of the qualification. If the department determines that an eligible building owner qualifies for an incentive payment, the department shall certify the qualification to the eligible building owner and to the person that administers incentive payments under ORS 469.289. (6) Not later than September 30, 2026, and by the same date every two years thereafter, the department shall report to interim committees of the Legislative Assembly related to energy concerning the operations and results of the incentive program the department establishes under this section. The report must include recommendations for aligning the incentive program with greenhouse gas emission reduction goals that meet or exceed the goals specified in ORS 468A.205.

It is, therefore, the purpose of ORS 469.300 to 469.563, 469.590 to 469.619, 469.930 and 469.992 to exercise the jurisdiction of the State of Oregon to the maximum extent permitted by the United States Constitution and to establish in cooperation with the federal government a comprehensive system for the siting, monitoring and regulating of the location, construction and operation of all energy facilities in this state. It is furthermore the policy of this state, notwithstanding ORS 469.010 (2)(f) and the definition of cost-effective in ORS 469.020, that the need for new generating facilities, as defined in ORS 469.503, is sufficiently addressed by reliance on competition in the market rather than by consideration of cost-effectiveness and shall not be a matter requiring determination by the Energy Facility Siting Council in the siting of a generating facility, as defined in ORS 469.503.

(1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (5) of this section, no facility shall be constructed or expanded unless a site certificate has been issued for the site thereof in the manner provided in ORS 469.300 to 469.563, 469.590 to 469.619, 469.930 and 469.992. No facility shall be constructed or operated except in conformity with the requirements of ORS 469.300 to 469.563, 469.590 to 469.619, 469.930 and 469.992. (2) A site certificate is not required for: (a) An energy facility for which no site certificate has been issued that, on August 2, 1993, had operable electric generating equipment for a modification that uses the same fuel type and increases electric generating capacity, if: (A) The site is not enlarged; and (B) The ability of the energy facility to use fuel for electricity production under peak steady state operating conditions is not more than 200 million Btu per hour greater than it was on August 2, 1993, or the energy facility expansion is called for in the short-term plan of action of an energy resource plan that has been acknowledged by the Public Utility Commission of Oregon. (b) Construction or expansion of any interstate natural gas pipeline or associated underground natural gas storage facility authorized by and subject to the continuing regulation of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or successor agency. (c) An energy facility, except coal and nuclear power plants, if the energy facility: (A) Sequentially produces electrical energy and useful thermal energy from the same fuel source; and (B) Under average annual operating conditions, has a nominal electric generating capacity: (i) Of less than 50 megawatts and the fuel chargeable to power heat rate value is not greater than 6,000 Btu per kilowatt hour; (ii) Of 50 megawatts or more and the fuel chargeable to power heat rate value is not greater than 5,500 Btu per kilowatt hour; or (iii) Specified by the Energy Facility Siting Council by rule based on the councils determination relating to emissions of the energy facility. (d) Temporary storage, at the site of a nuclear-fueled thermal power plant for which a site certificate has been issued by the State of Oregon, of radioactive waste from the plant. (e) An energy facility as defined in ORS 469.300 (11)(a)(G), if the plant also produces a secondary fuel used on site for the production of heat or electricity, if the output of the primary fuel is less than six billion Btu of heat a day. (f) An energy facility as defined in ORS 469.300 (11)(a)(G), if the facility: (A) Exclusively uses biomass, including but not limited to grain, whey, potatoes, oilseeds, waste vegetable oil or cellulosic biomass, as the source of material for conversion to a liquid fuel; (B) Has received local land use approval under the applicable acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations of the affected local government and the facility complies with any statewide planning goals or rules of the Land Conservation and Development Commission that are directly applicable to the facility; (C) Requires no new electric transmission lines or gas or petroleum product pipelines that would require a site certificate under subsection (1) of this section; (D) Produces synthetic fuel, at least 90 percent of which is used in an industrial or refueling facility located within one mile of the facility or is transported from the facility by rail or barge; and (E) Emits less than 118 pounds of carbon dioxide per million Btu from fossil fuel used for conversion energy. (g) A standby generation facility, if the facility complies with all of the following: (A) The facility has received local land use approval under the applicable acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations of the affected local government and the facility complies with all statewide planning goals and applicable rules of the Land Conservation and Development Commission; (B) The standby generators have been approved by the Department of Environmental Quality as having complied with all applicable air and water quality requirements. For an applicant that proposes to provide the physical facilities for the installation of standby generators, the requirement of this subparagraph may be met by agreeing to require such a term in the lease contract for the facility; and (C) The standby generators are electrically incapable of being interconnected to the transmission grid. For an applicant that proposes to provide the physical facilities for the installation of standby generators, the requirement of this subparagraph may be met by agreeing to require such a term in the lease contract for the facility. (3) The Energy Facility Siting Council may review and, if necessary, revise the fuel chargeable to power heat rate value set forth in subsection (2)(c)(B) of this section. In making its determination, the council shall ensure that the fuel chargeable to power heat rate value for facilities set forth in subsection (2)(c)(B) of this section remains significantly lower than the fuel chargeable to power heat rate value for the best available, commercially viable thermal power plant technology at the time of the revision. (4)(a)(A) Any person who proposes to construct or enlarge an energy facility and who claims an exemption under subsection (2)(a), (c) or (f) of this section from the requirement to obtain a site certificate shall request the Energy Facility Siting Council to determine whether the proposed facility qualifies for the claimed exemption. (B) The council may not require a person who operates or proposes to construct or enlarge an energy facility to request that the council determine whether the proposed facility qualifies for exemption under subsection (2)(g) of this section. (b) The council shall make its determination within 60 days after the request for exemption is filed. An appeal from the councils determination on a request for exemption shall be made under ORS 469.403, except that the scope of review by the Supreme Court shall be the same as a review by a circuit court under ORS 183.484. The record on review by the Supreme Court shall be the record established in the council proceeding on the exemption. (5) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a separate site certificate shall not be required for: (a) Transmission lines, storage facilities, pipelines or similar related or supporting facilities, if such related or supporting facilities are addressed in and are subject to a site certificate for another energy facility; (b) Expansion within the site or within the energy generation area of a facility for which a site certificate has been issued, if the existing site certificate has been amended to authorize expansion; or (c) Expansion, either within the site or outside the site, of an existing council certified surface facility related to an underground gas storage reservoir, if the existing site certificate is amended to authorize expansion. (6) If the substantial loss of the steam host causes a facility exempt under subsection (2)(c) of this section to substantially fail to meet the exemption requirements under subsection (2)(c) of this section, the electric generating facility shall cease to operate one year after the substantial loss of the steam host unless an application for a site certificate has been filed in accordance with the provisions of ORS 469.300 to 469.563. (7) As used in this section: (a) Standby generation facility means an electric power generating facility, including standby generators and the physical structures necessary to install and connect standby generators, that provides temporary electric power in the event of a power outage and that is electrically incapable of being interconnected with the transmission grid. (b) Total energy output means the sum of useful thermal energy output and useful electrical energy output. (c) Useful thermal energy means the verifiable thermal energy used in any viable industrial or commercial process, heating or cooling application. (8)(a) If the developer of a facility elects, or the governing body of the local government after consulting with the developer elects, to defer regulatory authority to the Energy Facility Siting Council, the developer of a facility shall obtain a site certificate, in the manner provided in ORS 469.300 to",

(2) Every person submitting a notice of intent to file for a site certificate, a request for exemption or a request for expedited review shall pay the fee required under the fee schedule established under ORS 469.441 to the department prior to submitting the notice or request to the council. To the extent possible, the full cost of the evaluation shall be paid from the fee paid under this subsection. However, if costs of the evaluation exceed the fee, the person submitting the notice or request shall pay any excess costs shown in an itemized statement prepared by the council. In no event shall the council incur evaluation expenses in excess of 110 percent of the fee initially paid unless the council provides prior notification to the applicant and a detailed projected budget the council believes necessary to complete the project. If costs are less than the fee paid, the excess shall be refunded to the person submitting the notice or request. (3) Before submitting a site certificate application, the applicant shall request from the department an estimate of the costs expected to be incurred in processing the application. The department shall inform the applicant of that amount and require the applicant to make periodic payments of the costs pursuant to a cost reimbursement agreement. The cost reimbursement agreement shall provide for payment of 25 percent of the estimated costs when the applicant submits the application. If costs of the evaluation exceed the estimate, the applicant shall pay any excess costs shown in an itemized statement prepared by the council. In no event shall the council incur evaluation expenses in excess of 110 percent of the fee initially estimated unless the council provided prior notification to the applicant and a detailed projected budget the council believes is necessary to complete the project. If costs are less than the fee paid, the council shall refund the excess to the applicant. (4) Any person who is delinquent in the payment of fees under subsections (1) to (3) of this section shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (11) of this section. (5) Subject to the provisions of ORS 469.441, each holder of a certificate shall pay an annual fee, due every July 1 following issuance of a site certificate. For each fiscal year, upon approval of the departments budget authorization by an odd-numbered year regular session of the Legislative Assembly or as revised by the Emergency Board meeting in an interim period or by the Legislative Assembly meeting in special session or in an even-numbered year regular session, the Director of the State Department of Energy promptly shall enter an order establishing an annual fee based on the amount of revenues that the director estimates is needed to fund the cost of ensuring that the facility is being operated consistently with the terms and conditions of the site certificate, any order issued by the department under ORS 469.405 (3) and any applicable health or safety standards. In determining this cost, the director shall include both the actual direct cost to be incurred by the council and the department to ensure that the facility is being operated consistently with the terms and conditions of the site certificate, any order issued by the department under ORS 469.405 (3) and any applicable health or safety standards, and the general costs to be incurred by the council and the department to ensure that all certificated facilities are being operated consistently with the terms and conditions of the site certificates, any orders issued by the department under ORS 469.405 (3) and any applicable health or safety standards that cannot be allocated to an individual, licensed facility. Not more than 35 percent of the annual fee charged each facility shall be for the recovery of these general costs. The fees for direct costs shall reflect the size and complexity of the facility, the anticipated costs of ensuring compliance with site certificate conditions, the anticipated costs of conducting site inspections and compliance reviews as described in ORS 469.430, and the anticipated costs of compensating state agencies and local governments for participating in site inspection and compliance enforcement activities at the request of the council. (6) Each holder of a site certificate executed after July 1 of any fiscal year shall pay a fee for the remaining portion of the year. The amount of the fee shall be set at the cost of regulating the facility during the remaining portion of the year determined in the same manner as the annual fee. (7) When the actual costs of regulation incurred by the council and the department for the year, including that portion of the general regulation costs that have been allocated to a particular facility, are less than the annual fees for that facility, the unexpended balance shall be refunded to the site certificate holder. When the actual regulation costs incurred by the council and the department for the year, including that portion of the general regulation costs that have been allocated to a particular facility, are projected to exceed the annual fee for that facility, the director may issue an order revising the annual fee. (8)(a) In addition to any other fees required by law, each energy resource supplier shall pay to the department annually its share of an assessment to fund the programs and activities of the council and the department. (b) Prior to filing an agency request budget under ORS 291.208 for purposes related to the compilation and preparation of the Governors budget under ORS 291.216, the director shall determine the projected aggregate amount of revenue to be collected from energy resource suppliers under this subsection that will be necessary to fund the programs and activities of the council and the department for each fiscal year of the upcoming biennium. After making that determination, the director shall convene a public meeting with representatives of energy resource suppliers and other interested parties for the purpose of providing energy resource suppliers with a full accounting of: (A) The projected revenue needed to fund each department program or activity; and (B) The projected allocation of moneys derived from the assessment imposed under this subsection to each department program or activity. (c) Upon approval of the budget authorization of the council and the department by an odd-numbered year regular session of the Legislative Assembly, the director shall promptly enter an order establishing the amount of revenues required to be derived from an assessment pursuant to this subsection in order to fund programs and activities that the council and the department are charged with administering and authorized to conduct under the laws of this state, including those enumerated in ORS 469.030, for the first fiscal year of the forthcoming biennium. On or before June 1 of each even-numbered year, the director shall enter an order establishing the amount of revenues required to be derived from an assessment pursuant to this subsection in order to fund the programs and activities that the council and the department are charged with administering and authorized to conduct under the laws of this state, including those enumerated in ORS 469.030, for the second fiscal year of the biennium. The order shall take into account any revisions to the biennial budget of the council and the department made by the Emergency Board meeting in an interim period or by the Legislative Assembly meeting in special session or in an even-numbered year regular session. (d) Each order issued by the director pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection shall allocate the aggregate assessment set forth in the order to energy resource suppliers in accordance with paragraph (e) of this subsection. (e) The amount assessed to an energy resource supplier shall be based on the ratio which that suppliers annual gross operating revenue derived within this state in the preceding calendar year bears to the total gross operating revenue derived within this state during that year by all energy resource suppliers. The assessment against an energy resource supplier shall not exceed 0.375 percent of the suppliers gross operating revenue derived within this state in the preceding calendar year. The director shall exempt from payment of an assessment any individual energy resource supplier whose calculated share of the annual assessment is less than $250. (f) The director shall send each energy resource supplier subject to assessment pursuant to this subsection a copy of each order issued by registered or certified mail or through use of an electronic medium with electronic receipt verification. The amount assessed to the energy resource supplier pursuant to the order shall be considered to the extent otherwise permitted by law a government-imposed cost and recoverable by the energy resource supplier as a cost included within the price of the service or product supplied. (g) The amounts assessed to individual energy resource suppliers pursuant to paragraph (e) of this subsection shall be paid to the department as follows: (A) Amounts assessed for the first fiscal year of a biennium shall be paid not later than 90 days following adjournment sine die of the odd-numbered year regular session of the Legislative Assembly; and (B) Amounts assessed for the second fiscal year of a biennium shall be paid not later than July 1 of each even-numbered year or 90 days following adjournment sine die of the even-numbered year regular session of the Legislative Assembly, whichever is later. (h) An energy resource supplier shall provide the director, on or before May 1 of each year, a verified statement showing its gross operating revenues derived within the state for the calendar or fiscal year that was used by the energy resource supplier for the purpose of reporting federal income taxes for the preceding calendar or fiscal year. The statement must be in the form prescribed by the director and is subject to audit by the director. The statement must include an entry showing the total operating revenue derived by petroleum suppliers from fuels sold that are subject to the requirements of Article IX, section 3a, of the Oregon Constitution, and ORS 319.020 with reference to aircraft fuel and motor vehicle fuel, and ORS 319.530. The director may grant an extension of not more than 15 days for the requirements of this subsection if: (A) The energy supplier makes a showing of hardship caused by the deadline; (B) The energy supplier provides reasonable assurance that the energy supplier can comply with the revised deadline; and (C) The extension of time does not prevent the council or the department from fulfilling its statutory responsibilities. (i) As used in this section: (A) Energy resource supplier means an electric utility, natural gas utility or petroleum supplier supplying, generating, transmitting or distributing electricity, natural gas or petroleum products in Oregon. (B) Gross operating revenue means gross receipts from sales or service made or provided within this state during the regular course of the energy suppliers business, but does not include either revenue derived from interutility sales within the state or revenue received by a petroleum supplier from the sale of fuels that are subject to the requirements of Article IX, section 3a, of the Oregon Constitution, or ORS 319.020 or 319.530. (C) Petroleum supplier has the meaning given that term in ORS 469.020. (j) In determining the amount of revenues that must be derived from any class of energy resource suppliers by assessment pursuant to this subsection, the director shall take into account all other known or readily ascertainable sources of revenue to the council and department, including, but not limited to, fees imposed under this section and federal funds, and may take into account any funds previously assessed pursuant to ORS 469.420 (1979 Replacement Part) or section 7, chapter 792, Oregon Laws 1981. (k) Orders issued by the director pursuant to this section shall be subject to judicial review under ORS 183.484. The taking of judicial review shall not operate to stay the obligation of an energy resource supplier to pay amounts assessed to it on or before the statutory deadline. (9)(a) In addition to any other fees required by law, each operator of a nuclear fueled thermal power plant or nuclear installation within this state shall pay to the department annually on July 1 an assessment in an amount determined by the director to be necessary to fund the activities of the state and the counties associated with emergency preparedness for a nuclear fueled thermal power plant or nuclear installation. The assessment shall not exceed $461,250 per year. Moneys collected as assessments under this subsection are continuously appropriated to the department for this purpose. (b) The department shall maintain and cause other state agencies and counties to maintain time and billing records for the expenditure of any fees collected from an operator of a nuclear fueled thermal power plant under paragraph (a) of this subsection. (10) Reactors operated by a college, university or graduate center for research purposes and electric utilities not connected to the Northwest Power Grid are exempt from the fee requirements of subsections (5), (8) and (9) of this section. (11)(a) All fees assessed by the director against holders of site certificates for facilities that have an installed capacity of 500 megawatts or greater may be paid in several installments, the schedule for which shall be negotiated between the director and the site certificate holder. (b) Energy resource suppliers or applicants or holders of a site certificate who fail to pay a fee provided under subsections (1) to (9) of this section after it is due and payable shall pay, in addition to that fee, a penalty of two percent of the fee a month for the period that the fee is past due. Any payment made according to the terms of a schedule negotiated under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not be considered past due.

(2) An applicant seeking expedited review under this section shall submit documentation to the State Department of Energy, prior to the submission of an application for a site certificate, that demonstrates that the energy facility meets the qualifications set forth in subsection (1) of this section. The department shall determine, within 14 days of receipt of the documentation, on a preliminary, nonbinding basis, whether the energy facility qualifies for expedited review. (3) If the department determines that the energy facility preliminarily qualifies for expedited review, the applicant may submit an application for expedited review. Within 30 days after the date that the application for expedited review is submitted, the department shall determine whether the application is complete. If the department determines that the application is complete, the application shall be deemed filed on the date that the department sends the applicant notice of its determination. If the department determines that the application is not complete, the department shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies in the application and shall deem the application filed on the date that the department determines that the application is complete. The department or the council may request additional information from the applicant at any time. (4) The State Department of Energy shall send a copy of a filed application to the Department of Environmental Quality, the Water Resources Department, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, the State Department of Agriculture, the Department of Land Conservation and Development, the Public Utility Commission and any other state agency, city, county or political subdivision of the state that has regulatory or advisory responsibility with respect to the proposed energy facility. The State Department of Energy shall send with the copy of the filed application a notice specifying that: (a) In the event the council issues a site certificate for the energy facility, the site certificate will bind the state and all counties, cities and political subdivisions in the state as to the approval of the site, the construction of the energy facility and the operation of the energy facility, and that after the issuance of a site certificate, all permits, licenses and certificates addressed in the site certificate must be issued as required by ORS 469.401 (3); and (b) The comments and recommendations of state agencies, counties, cities and political subdivisions concerning whether the proposed energy facility complies with any statute, rule or local ordinance that the state agency, county, city or political subdivision would normally administer in determining whether a permit, license or certificate required for the construction or operation of the energy facility should be approved will be considered only if the comments and recommendations are received by the department within a reasonable time after the date the application and notice of the application are sent by the department. (5) Within 90 days after the date that the application was filed, the department shall issue a draft proposed order setting forth: (a) A description of the proposed energy facility; (b) A list of the permits, licenses and certificates that are addressed in the application and that are required for the construction or operation of the proposed energy facility; (c) A list of the statutes, rules and local ordinances that are the standards and criteria for approval of any permit, license or certificate addressed in the application and that are required for the construction or operation of the proposed energy facility; and (d) Proposed findings specifying how the proposed energy facility complies with the applicable standards and criteria for approval of a site certificate. (6) The council shall review the application for site certification in the manner set forth in subsections (7) to (10) of this section and shall issue a site certificate for the facility if the council determines that the facility, with any required conditions to the site certificate, will comply with: (a) The requirements for expedited review as specified in this section; (b) The standards adopted by the council pursuant to ORS 469.501 (1)(a), (c) to (e), (g), (h) and (L) to (o); (c) The requirements of ORS 469.503 (3); and (d) The requirements of ORS 469.504 (1)(b). (7) Following submission of an application for a site certificate, the council shall hold a public informational meeting on the application. Following the issuance of the proposed order, the council shall hold at least one public hearing on the application. The public hearing shall be held in the area affected by the energy facility. The council shall mail notice of the hearing at least 20 days prior to the hearing. The notice shall comply with the notice requirements of ORS 197.797 (2) and shall include, but need not be limited to, the following: (a) A description of the energy facility and the general location of the energy facility; (b) The name of a department representative to contact and the telephone number at which people may obtain additional information; (c) A statement that copies of the application and proposed order are available for inspection at no cost and will be provided at reasonable cost; and (d) A statement that the record for public comment on the application will close at the conclusion of the hearing and that failure to raise an issue in person or in writing prior to the close of the record, with sufficient specificity to afford the decision maker an opportunity to respond to the issue, will preclude consideration of the issue, by the council or by a court on judicial review of the councils decision. (8) Prior to the conclusion of the hearing, the applicant may request an opportunity to present additional written evidence, arguments or testimony regarding the application. In the alternative, prior to the conclusion of the hearing, the applicant may request a contested case hearing on the application. If the applicant requests an opportunity to present written evidence, arguments or testimony, the council shall leave the record open for that purpose only for a period not to exceed 14 days after the date of the hearing. Following the close of the record, the department shall prepare a draft final order for the council. If the applicant requests a contested case hearing, the council may grant the request if the applicant has shown good cause for a contested case hearing. If a request for a contested case hearing is granted, subsections (9) to (11) of this section do not apply, and the application shall be considered under the same contested case procedures used for a nonexpedited application for a site certificate. (9) The council shall make its decision based on the record and the draft final order prepared by the department. The council shall, within six months of the date that the application is deemed filed: (a) Grant the application; (b) Grant the application with conditions; (c) Deny the application; or (d) Return the application to the site certification process required by ORS",

Issues on appeal shall be limited to those raised by the parties to the contested case proceeding before the council. (3) Jurisdiction for judicial review of the councils approval or rejection of an application for a site certificate or amended site certificate is conferred upon the Supreme Court. Proceedings for review shall be instituted by filing a petition in the Supreme Court. The petition shall be filed within 60 days after the date of service of the councils final order or within 30 days after the date the petition for rehearing is denied or deemed denied. Date of service shall be the date on which the council delivered or mailed its order in accordance with ORS 183.470. (4) The filing of a petition for judicial review may not stay the order, except that a party to the contested case may apply to the Supreme Court for a stay upon a showing that there is a colorable claim of error and that: (a) The petitioner will suffer irreparable injury; or (b) Construction of the energy facility will result in irreparable harm to resources protected by applicable council standards or applicable agency or local government standards. (5) If the Supreme Court grants a stay pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, the court: (a) Shall require the petitioner requesting the stay to give an undertaking in the amount of $5,000. (b) May grant a stay in whole or in part. (c) May impose other reasonable conditions on the stay. (6) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 469.320 and this section, the review by the Supreme Court shall be the same as the review by the Court of Appeals described in ORS 183.482. The Supreme Court shall give priority on its docket to such a petition for review and shall render a decision within six months of the filing of the petition for review. (7) The following periods of delay shall be excluded from the six-month period within which the court must render a decision under subsection (6) of this section: (a) Any period of delay resulting from a motion properly before the court; or (b) Any reasonable period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by the court on the courts own motion or at the request of one of the parties, if the court granted the continuance on the basis of findings that the ends of justice served by granting the continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the other parties in having a decision within six months. (8) No period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by the Supreme Court under subsection (7)(b) of this section shall be excluded from the six-month period unless the court sets forth, in the record, either orally or in writing, its reasons for finding that the ends of justice served by granting the continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the other parties in having a decision within six months. The factors the court shall consider in determining whether to grant a continuance under subsection (7)(b) of this section are: (a) Whether the failure to grant a continuance in the proceeding would be likely to make a continuation of the proceeding impossible or result in a miscarriage of justice; or (b) Whether the case is so unusual or so complex, due to the number of parties involved or the existence of novel questions of fact or law, that it is unreasonable to expect adequate consideration of the issues within the six-month period. (9) No continuance under subsection (7)(b) of this section shall be granted because of general congestion of the court calendar or lack of diligent preparation or attention to the case by any member of the court or any party.",

Legislative findings about offshore wind energy. (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that: (a) Oregon offshore wind holds tremendous potential and promise for this state to diversify its energy portfolio. (b) Oregon has an opportunity to participate in a growing global market by contributing to the development of the nascent offshore wind energy supply chain. (c) An intergovernmental task force led by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has reengaged and is expected to reveal offshore wind call areas in 2021 for the development of floating offshore wind energy within the federal waters off the Oregon coast. (d) Oregon has an opportunity to participate in holistic west coast planning for the strategic integration of floating offshore wind energy within the next decade and to position itself for potential market expansion thereafter. (e) The Department of Land Conservation and Development has an established role as the lead state agency coordinating with the federal process for floating offshore wind development and, as the lead agency of the federally approved Oregon Coastal Management Program, the department implements the states federal consistency authority pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 and associated federal regulations. The department implements federal consistency review by evaluating federal activities for compliance with state enforceable policies and their reasonably foreseeable effects to coastal uses and resources of the Oregon coastal zone, and the department will coordinate with networked agency and local government partners to evaluate floating offshore wind development activities for consistency with the Oregon Coastal Management Program. (f) The Oregon Business Development Department has established a leadership role in facilitating attracting the floating offshore wind energy industry to this state and in facilitating floating offshore wind energy supply chain development. (g) Understanding the impacts, benefits, opportunities and barriers of floating offshore wind energy with respect to Oregons fishing communities, ocean and shore-side recreational users, tribes, ports, coastal ecosystems, natural resources, manufacturing industry, maritime sector, disaster recovery planning, workforce development and electricity ratepayers can maximize the benefits to this state, while minimizing the conflicts between floating offshore wind energy, the ocean ecosystem and ocean users. (h) Defining a pathway for Oregon to take advantage to the fullest extent possible of the federal offshore wind investment tax credit and other federal infrastructure investment programs that could benefit Oregons ports and transmission system can facilitate immediate economic investments as well as long term ratepayer savings. (i) Understanding the feasibility of using offshore wind as a clean power source for the future in-state generation of renewable fuel such as renewable hydrogen will strengthen state and regional energy decarbonization planning scenarios. (j) Investigating potential mechanisms to integrate floating offshore wind energy into Oregons future energy mix will strengthen state and regional energy decarbonization strategies. (2) In furtherance of the findings set forth in subsection (1) of this section, the Legislative Assembly finds and declares that: (a) It is the goal of this state to plan for the development of up to three gigawatts of floating offshore wind energy projects within the federal waters off the Oregon coast by 2030; (b) It is further the goal of this state that the planning described in this subsection be conducted in a manner that will maximize benefits to this state while minimizing conflicts between floating offshore wind energy, the ocean ecosystem and ocean users; and (c) Consistent with applicable federal law, it shall be the policy position of the State of Oregon that: (A) Any federal planning or permitting process for offshore energy research and development in federal waters off the Oregon coast and for any related transmission and other facilities, particularly those that transverse Oregons territorial sea, shall adequately consider the prompt decommissioning of any offshore facility after permanent cessation of use of the facility; and (B) Adequate consideration as described in this paragraph must include consideration of the removal or decommissioning of anchors, cables and any other equipment related to the facility in a manner that will serve to avoid future conflicts between the equipment and fishing operations conducted by persons who hold licenses issued pursuant to the commercial fishing laws.",

      "text": "Requirements for approval of energy facility site certificate; carbon dioxide emissions standard; offset funds; use of offset funds by qualifying organization; rules. In order to issue a site certificate, the Energy Facility Siting Council shall determine that the preponderance of the evidence on the record supports the following conclusions: (1) The facility complies with the applicable standards adopted by the council pursuant to ORS 469.501 or the overall public benefits of the facility outweigh any adverse effects on a resource or interest protected by the applicable standards the facility does not meet. (2) If the energy facility is a fossil-fueled power plant, the energy facility complies with any applicable carbon dioxide emissions standard adopted by the council or enacted by statute. Base load gas plants shall comply with the standard set forth in subsection (2)(a) of this section. Other fossil-fueled power plants shall comply with any applicable standard adopted by the council by rule pursuant to subsection (2)(b) of this section. Subsections (2)(c) and (d) of this section prescribe the means by which an applicant may comply with the applicable standard. (a) The net carbon dioxide emissions rate of the proposed base load gas plant shall not exceed 0.70 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt hour of net electric power output, with carbon dioxide emissions and net electric power output measured on a new and clean basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the council may by rule modify the carbon dioxide emissions standard for base load gas plants if the council finds that the most efficient stand-alone combined cycle, combustion turbine, natural gas-fired energy facility that is commercially demonstrated and operating in the United States has a net heat rate of less than 7,200 Btu per kilowatt hour higher heating value adjusted to ISO conditions. In modifying the carbon dioxide emission standard, the council shall determine the rate of carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt hour of net electric output of such energy facility, adjusted to ISO conditions, and reset the carbon dioxide emissions standard at 17 percent below this rate. (b) The council shall adopt carbon dioxide emissions standards for other types of fossil-fueled power plants. Such carbon dioxide emissions standards shall be promulgated by rule. In adopting or amending such carbon dioxide emissions standards, the council shall consider and balance at least the following principles, the findings on which shall be contained in the rulemaking record: (A) Promote facility fuel efficiency; (B) Promote efficiency in the resource mix; (C) Reduce net carbon dioxide emissions; (D) Promote cogeneration that reduces net carbon dioxide emissions; (E) Promote innovative technologies and creative approaches to mitigating, reducing or avoiding carbon dioxide emissions; (F) Minimize transaction costs; (G) Include an alternative process that separates decisions on the form and implementation of offsets from the final decision on granting a site certificate; (H) Allow either the applicant or third parties to implement offsets; (I) Be attainable and economically achievable for various types of power plants; (J) Promote public participation in the selection and review of offsets; (K) Promote prompt implementation of offset projects; (L) Provide for monitoring and evaluation of the performance of offsets; and (M) Promote reliability of the regional electric system. (c) The council shall determine whether the applicable carbon dioxide emissions standard is met by first determining the gross carbon dioxide emissions that are reasonably likely to result from the operation of the proposed energy facility. Such determination shall be based on the proposed design of the energy facility. The council shall adopt site certificate conditions to ensure that the predicted carbon dioxide emissions are not exceeded on a new and clean basis. For any remaining emissions reduction necessary to meet the applicable standard, the applicant may elect to use any of subparagraphs (A) to (D) of this paragraph, or any combination thereof. The council shall determine the amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions reduction that is reasonably likely to result from the applicants offsets and whether the resulting net carbon dioxide emissions meet the applicable carbon dioxide emissions standard. For purposes of determining the net carbon dioxide emissions, the council shall by rule establish the global warming potential of each greenhouse gas based on a generally accepted scientific method, and convert any greenhouse gas emissions to a carbon dioxide equivalent. Unless otherwise provided by the council by rule, the global warming potential of methane is 23 times that of carbon dioxide, and the global warming potential of nitrous oxide is 296 times that of carbon dioxide. If the council or a court on judicial review concludes that the applicant has not demonstrated compliance with the applicable carbon dioxide emissions standard under subparagraphs (A), (B) or (D) of this paragraph, or any combination thereof, and the applicant has agreed to meet the requirements of subparagraph (C) of this paragraph for any deficiency, the council or a court shall find compliance based on such agreement. (A) The facility will sequentially produce electrical and thermal energy from the same fuel source, and the thermal energy will be used to displace another source of carbon dioxide emissions that would have otherwise continued to occur, in which case the council shall adopt site certificate conditions ensuring that the carbon dioxide emissions reduction will be achieved. (B) The applicant or a third party will implement particular offsets, in which case the council may adopt site certificate conditions ensuring that the proposed offsets are implemented but shall not require that predicted levels of avoidance, displacement or sequestration of greenhouse gas emissions be achieved. The council shall determine the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions reduction that is reasonably likely to result from each of the proposed offsets based on the criteria in sub-subparagraphs (i) to (iii) of this subparagraph. In making this determination, the council shall not allow credit for offsets that have already been allocated or awarded credit for greenhouse gas emissions reduction in another regulatory setting. In addition, the fact that an applicant or other parties involved with an offset may derive benefits from the offset other than the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is not, by itself, a basis for withholding credit for an offset. (i) The degree of certainty that the predicted quantity of greenhouse gas emissions reduction will be achieved by the offset; (ii) The ability of the council to determine the actual quantity of greenhouse gas emissions reduction resulting from the offset, taking into consideration any proposed measurement, monitoring and evaluation of mitigation measure performance; and (iii) The extent to which the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions would occur in the absence of the offsets. (C) The applicant or a third party agrees to provide funds in an amount deemed sufficient to produce the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions necessary to meet the applicable carbon dioxide emissions standard, in which case the funds shall be used as specified in paragraph (d) of this subsection. Unless modified by the council as provided below, the payment of 57 cents shall be deemed to result in a reduction of one ton of carbon dioxide emissions. The council shall determine the offset funds using the monetary offset rate and the level of emissions reduction required to meet the applicable standard. If a site certificate is approved based on this subparagraph, the council may not adjust the amount of such offset funds based on the actual performance of offsets. After three years from June 26, 1997, the council may by rule increase or decrease the monetary offset rate of 57 cents per ton of carbon dioxide emissions. Any change to the monetary offset rate shall be based on empirical evidence of the cost of offsets and the councils finding that the standard will be economically achievable with the modified rate for natural gas-fired power plants. Following the initial three-year period, the council may increase or decrease the monetary offset rate no more than 50 percent in any two-year period. (D) Any other means that the council adopts by rule for demonstrating compliance with any applicable carbon dioxide emissions standard. (d) If the applicant elects to meet the applicable carbon dioxide emissions standard in whole or in part under paragraph (c)(C) of this subsection, the applicant shall identify the qualified organization. The applicant may identify an organization that has applied for, but has not received, an exemption from federal income taxation, but the council may not find that the organization is a qualified organization unless the organization is exempt from federal taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code as amended and in effect on December 31, 1996. The site certificate holder shall provide a bond or comparable security in a form reasonably acceptable to the council to ensure the payment of the offset funds and the amount required under subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph. Such security shall be provided by the date specified in the site certificate, which shall be no later than the commencement of construction of the facility. The site certificate shall require that the offset funds be disbursed as specified in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, unless the council finds that no qualified organization exists, in which case the site certificate shall require that the offset funds be disbursed as specified in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. (A) The site certificate holder shall disburse the offset funds and any other funds required by sub-subparagraph (ii) of this subparagraph to the qualified organization as follows: (i) When the site certificate holder receives written notice from the qualified organization certifying that the qualified organization is contractually obligated to pay any funds to implement offsets using the offset funds, the site certificate holder shall make the requested amount available to the qualified organization unless the total of the amount requested and any amounts previously requested exceeds the offset funds, in which case only the remaining amount of the offset funds shall be made available. The qualified organization shall use at least 80 percent of the offset funds for contracts to implement offsets. The qualified organization shall assess offsets for their potential to qualify in, generate credits in or reduce obligations in other regulatory settings. The qualified organization may use up to 20 percent of the offset funds for monitoring, evaluation, administration and enforcement of contracts to implement offsets. (ii) At the request of the qualified organization and in addition to the offset funds, the site certificate holder shall pay the qualified organization an amount equal to 10 percent of the first $500,000 of the offset funds and 4.286 percent of any offset funds in excess of $500,000. This amount shall not be less than $50,000 unless a lesser amount is specified in the site certificate. This amount compensates the qualified organization for its costs of selecting offsets and contracting for the implementation of offsets. (iii) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, a site certificate holder subject to this subparagraph shall have no obligation with regard to offsets, the offset funds or the funds required by sub-subparagraph (ii) of this subparagraph other than to make available to the qualified organization the total amount required under paragraph (c) of this subsection and sub-subparagraph (ii) of this subparagraph, nor shall any nonperformance, negligence or misconduct on the part of the qualified organization be a basis for revocation of the site certificate or any other enforcement action by the council with respect to the site certificate holder. (B) If the council finds there is no qualified organization, the site certificate holder shall select one or more offsets to be implemented pursuant to criteria established by the council. The site certificate holder shall give written notice of its selections to the council and to any person requesting notice. On petition by the State Department of Energy, or by any person adversely affected or aggrieved by the site certificate holders selection of offsets, or on the councils own motion, the council may review such selection. The petition must be received by the council within 30 days of the date the notice of selection is placed in the United States mail, with first-class postage prepaid. The council shall approve the site certificate holders selection unless it finds that the selection is not consistent with criteria established by the council. The site certificate holder shall contract to implement the selected offsets within 18 months after commencing construction of the facility unless good cause is shown requiring additional time. The contracts shall obligate the expenditure of at least 85 percent of the offset funds for the implementation of offsets. No more than 15 percent of the offset funds may be spent on monitoring, evaluation and enforcement of the contract to implement the selected offsets. The councils criteria for selection of offsets shall be based on the criteria set forth in paragraphs (b)(C) and (c)(B) of this subsection and may also consider the costs of particular types of offsets in relation to the expected benefits of such offsets. The councils criteria shall not require the site certificate holder to select particular offsets, and shall allow the site certificate holder a reasonable range of choices in selecting offsets. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the site certificate holders financial liability for implementation, monitoring, evaluation and enforcement of offsets pursuant to this subsection shall be limited to the amount of any offset funds not already contractually obligated. Nonperformance, negligence or misconduct by the entity or entities implementing, monitoring or evaluating the selected offset shall not be a basis for revocation of the site certificate or any other enforcement action by the council with respect to the site certificate holder. (C) Every qualified organization that has received funds under this paragraph shall, at five-year intervals beginning on the date of receipt of such funds, provide the council with the information the council requests about the qualified organizations performance. The council shall evaluate the information requested and, based on such information, shall make any recommendations to the Legislative Assembly that the council deems appropriate. (e) As used in this subsection: (A) Adjusted to ISO conditions means carbon dioxide emissions and net electric power output as determined at 59 degrees Fahrenheit, 14.7 pounds per square inch atmospheric pressure and 60 percent humidity. (B) Base load gas plant means a generating facility that is fueled by natural gas, except for periods during which an alternative fuel may be used and when such alternative fuel use shall not exceed 10 percent of expected fuel use in Btu, higher heating value, on an average annual basis, and where the applicant requests and the council adopts no condition in the site certificate for the generating facility that would limit hours of operation other than restrictions on the use of alternative fuel. The council shall assume a 100 percent capacity factor for such plants and a 30-year life for the plants for purposes of determining gross carbon dioxide emissions. (C) Carbon dioxide equivalent means the global warming potential of a greenhouse gas reflected in units of carbon dioxide. (D) Fossil-fueled power plant means a generating facility that produces electric power from natural gas, petroleum, coal or any form of solid, liquid or gaseous fuel derived from such material. (E) Generating facility means those energy facilities that are defined in ORS",

(1) A proposed facility shall be found in compliance with the statewide planning goals under ORS 469.503 (4) if: (a) The facility has received local land use approval under the acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations of the affected local government; or (b) The Energy Facility Siting Council determines that: (A) The facility complies with applicable substantive criteria from the affected local governments acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations that are required by the statewide planning goals and in effect on the date the application is submitted, and with any Land Conservation and Development Commission administrative rules and goals and any land use statutes that apply directly to the facility under ORS 197.646; (B) For an energy facility or a related or supporting facility that must be evaluated against the applicable substantive criteria pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, that the proposed facility does not comply with one or more of the applicable substantive criteria but does otherwise comply with the applicable statewide planning goals, or that an exception to any applicable statewide planning goal is justified under subsection (2) of this section; or (C) For a facility that the council elects to evaluate against the statewide planning goals pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, that the proposed facility complies with the applicable statewide planning goals or that an exception to any applicable statewide planning goal is justified under subsection (2) of this section. (2) The council may find goal compliance for a facility that does not otherwise comply with one or more statewide planning goals by taking an exception to the applicable goal. Notwithstanding the requirements of ORS 197.732, the statewide planning goal pertaining to the exception process or any rules of the Land Conservation and Development Commission pertaining to an exception process goal, the council may take an exception to a goal if the council finds: (a) The land subject to the exception is physically developed to the extent that the land is no longer available for uses allowed by the applicable goal; (b) The land subject to the exception is irrevocably committed as described by the rules of the Land Conservation and Development Commission to uses not allowed by the applicable goal because existing adjacent uses and other relevant factors make uses allowed by the applicable goal impracticable; or (c) The following standards are met: (A) Reasons justify why the state policy embodied in the applicable goal should not apply; (B) The significant environmental, economic, social and energy consequences anticipated as a result of the proposed facility have been identified and adverse impacts will be mitigated in accordance with rules of the council applicable to the siting of the proposed facility; and (C) The proposed facility is compatible with other adjacent uses or will be made compatible through measures designed to reduce adverse impacts. (3) If compliance with applicable substantive local criteria and applicable statutes and state administrative rules would result in conflicting conditions in the site certificate or amended site certificate, the council shall resolve the conflict consistent with the public interest. A resolution may not result in a waiver of any applicable state statute. (4) An applicant for a site certificate shall elect whether to demonstrate compliance with the statewide planning goals under subsection (1)(a) or (b) of this section. The applicant shall make the election on or before the date specified by the council by rule. (5) Upon request by the State Department of Energy, the special advisory group established under ORS 469.480 shall recommend to the council, within the time stated in the request, the applicable substantive criteria under subsection (1)(b)(A) of this section. If the special advisory group does not recommend applicable substantive criteria within the time established in the departments request, the council may either determine and apply the applicable substantive criteria under subsection (1)(b) of this section or determine compliance with the statewide planning goals under subsection (1)(b)(B) or (C) of this section. If the special advisory group recommends applicable substantive criteria for an energy facility described in ORS 469.300 or a related or supporting facility that does not pass through more than one local government jurisdiction or more than three zones in any one jurisdiction, the council shall apply the criteria recommended by the special advisory group. If the special advisory group recommends applicable substantive criteria for an energy facility as defined in ORS 469.300 (11)(a)(C) to (E) or a related or supporting facility that passes through more than one jurisdiction or more than three zones in any one jurisdiction, the council shall review the recommended criteria and determine whether to evaluate the proposed facility against the applicable substantive criteria recommended by the special advisory group, against the statewide planning goals or against a combination of the applicable substantive criteria and statewide planning goals. In making its determination, the council shall consult with the special advisory group and shall consider: (a) The number of jurisdictions and zones in question; (b) The degree to which the applicable substantive criteria reflect local government consideration of energy facilities in the planning process; and (c) The level of consistency of the applicable substantive criteria from the various zones and jurisdictions. (6) The council is not subject to ORS 197.180 and a state agency may not require an applicant for a site certificate to comply with any rules or programs adopted under ORS 197.180. (7) On or before its next periodic review, each affected local government shall amend its comprehensive plan and land use regulations as necessary to reflect the decision of the council pertaining to a site certificate or amended site certificate. (8) Notwithstanding ORS 34.020 or 197.825 or any other provision of law, the affected local governments land use approval of a proposed facility under subsection (1)(a) of this section and the special advisory groups recommendation of applicable substantive criteria under subsection (5) of this section shall be subject to judicial review only as provided in ORS 469.403. If the applicant elects to comply with subsection (1)(a) of this section, the provisions of this subsection shall apply only to proposed projects for which the land use approval of the local government occurs after the date a notice of intent or an application for expedited processing is submitted to the State Department of Energy. (9) The State Department of Energy, in cooperation with other state agencies, shall provide, to the extent possible, technical assistance and information about the siting process to local governments that request such assistance or that anticipate having a facility proposed in their jurisdiction.

      "text": "Northwest Interstate Compact on Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management. The Northwest Interstate Compact on Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management is enacted into law by the State of Oregon and entered into with all other jurisdictions lawfully joining therein in a form as provided for as follows: ______________________________________________________________________________ ARTICLE I Policy and Purpose The party states recognize that low-level radioactive wastes are generated by essential activities and services that benefit the citizens of the states. It is further recognized that the protection of the health and safety of the citizens of the party states and the most economical management of low-level radioactive wastes can be accomplished through cooperation of the states in minimizing the amount of handling and transportation required to dispose of such wastes and through the cooperation of the states in providing facilities that serve the region. It is the policy of the party states to undertake the necessary cooperation to protect the health and safety of the citizens of the party states and to provide for the most economical management of low-level radioactive wastes on a continuing basis. It is the purpose of this compact to provide the means for such a cooperative effort among the party states so that the protection of the citizens of the states and the maintenance of the viability of the states economies will be enhanced while sharing the responsibilities of radioactive low-level waste management. ARTICLE II Definitions As used in this compact: (1) Facility means any site, location, structure or property used or to be used for the storage, treatment or disposal of low-level waste, excluding federal waste facilities. (2) Low-level waste means waste material which contains radioactive nuclides emitting primarily beta or gamma radiation, or both, in concentrations or quantities which exceed applicable federal or state standards for unrestricted release. Low-level waste does not include waste containing more than 10 nanocuries of transuranic contaminants per gram of material, nor spent reactor fuel, nor material classified as either high-level waste or waste which is unsuited for disposal by near-surface burial under any applicable federal regulations. (3) Generator means any person, partnership, association, corporation or any other entity whatsoever which, as a part of its activities, produces low-level radioactive waste. (4) Host state means a state in which a facility is located. ARTICLE III Regulatory Practices Each party state hereby agrees to adopt practices which will require low-level waste shipments originating within its borders and destined for a facility within another party state to conform to the applicable packaging and transportation requirements and regulations of the host state. Such practices shall include: (1) Maintaining an inventory of all generators within the state that have shipped or expect to ship low-level waste to facilities in another party state. (2) Periodic unannounced inspection of the premises of such generators and the waste management activities thereon. (3) Authorization of the containers in which such waste may be shipped and a requirement that generators use only that type of container authorized by the state. (4) Assurance that inspections of the carriers which transport such waste are conducted by proper authorities and appropriate enforcement action is taken for violations. (5) After receiving notification from a host state that a generator within the party state is in violation of applicable packaging or transportation standards, the party state will take appropriate action to assure that such violations do not recur. Such action may include inspection of every individual low-level waste shipment by that generator. (6) Each party state may impose fees upon generators and shippers to recover the cost of the inspections and other practices under this Article. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to limit any party states authority to impose additional or more stringent standards on generators or carriers than those required under this Article. ARTICLE IV Regional Facilities (1) Facilities located in any party state, other than facilities established or maintained by individual low-level waste generators for the management of their own low-level waste, shall accept low-level waste generated in any party state if such waste has been packaged and transported according to applicable laws and regulations. (2) No facility located in any party state may accept low-level waste generated outside of the region comprised of the party states, except as provided in Article V. (3) Until such time as paragraph (2) of this Article takes effect as provided in Article VI, facilities located in any party state may accept low-level waste generated outside of any of the party states only if such waste is accompanied by a certificate of compliance issued by an official of the state in which such waste shipment originated. Such certificate shall be in such form as may be required by the host state and shall contain at least the following: (a) The generators name and address; (b) A description of the contents of the low-level waste container; (c) A statement that the low-level waste being shipped has been inspected by the official who issued the certificate or by an agent of the official or by a representative of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and found to have been packaged in compliance with applicable federal regulations and such additional requirements as may be imposed by the host state; and (d) A binding agreement by the state of origin to reimburse any party state for any liability or expense incurred as a result of an accidental release of such waste, during shipment or after such waste reaches the facility. (4) Each party state shall cooperate with the other party states in determining the appropriate site of any facility that might be required within the region comprised of the party states, in order to maximize public health and safety while minimizing the use of any one party state as the host of such facilities on a permanent basis. Each party state further agrees that decisions regarding low-level waste management facilities in the region will be reached through a good faith process which takes into account the burdens borne by each of the party states as well as the benefits each has received. (5) The party states recognize that the issue of hazardous chemical waste management is similar in many respects to that of low-level waste management. Therefore, in consideration of the State of Washington allowing access to its low-level waste disposal facility by generators in other party states, party states such as Oregon and Idaho which host hazardous chemical waste disposal facilities will allow access to such facilities by generators within other party states. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent any party state from limiting the nature and type of hazardous chemical or low-level wastes to be accepted at facilities within its borders or from ordering the closure of such facilities, so long as such action by a host state is applied equally to all generators within the region comprised of the party states. (6) Any host state may establish a schedule of fees and requirements related to its facility to assure that closure, perpetual care, and maintenance and contingency requirements are met, including adequate bonding. ARTICLE V Northwest Low-Level Waste Compact Committee The governor of each party state shall designate one official of that state as the person responsible for administration of this compact. The officials so designated shall together comprise the Northwest low-level waste compact committee. The committee shall meet as required to consider matters arising under this compact. The parties shall inform the committee of existing regulations concerning low-level waste management in their states and shall afford all parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any proposed modifications in such regulations. Notwithstanding any provision of Article IV to the contrary, the committee may enter into arrangements with states, provinces, individual generators or regional compact entities outside the region comprised of the party states for access to facilities on such terms and conditions as the committee may deem appropriate. However, it shall require a two-thirds vote of all such members, including the affirmative vote of the member of any party state in which a facility affected by such arrangement is located, for the committee to enter into such arrangement. ARTICLE VI Eligible Parties and Effective Date (1) Each of the following states is eligible to become a party to this compact: Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. As to any eligible party, this compact shall become effective upon enactment into law by that party, but it shall not become initially effective until enacted into law by two states. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing its approval. (2) After the compact has initially taken effect pursuant to paragraph (1) of this Article any eligible party state may become a party to this compact by the execution of an executive order by the governor of the state. Any state which becomes a party in this manner shall cease to be a party upon the final adjournment of the next general or regular session of its legislature or July 1, 1983, whichever occurs first, unless the compact has by then been enacted as a statute by that state. (3) Paragraph (2) of Article IV of this compact shall take effect on July 1, 1983, if consent is given by Congress. As provided in Public Law 96-573, Congress may withdraw its consent to the compact after every five-year period. ARTICLE VII Severability If any provision of this compact, or its application to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, all other provisions of this compact, and the application of all of its provisions to all other persons and circumstances, shall remain valid; and to this end the provisions of this compact are severable. ______________________________________________________________________________",
