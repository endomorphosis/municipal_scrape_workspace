      "text": "Legislative intent. The Legislative Assembly recognizes that agriculture and related land uses contribute significantly to Oregons character and economy. The Legislative Assembly finds that providing the means for agriculture to continue and prosper is in the interest of all residents of this state, who benefit directly or indirectly from agricultural production and stewardship of farmlands and ranchlands. Valuation of farm properties based upon market data from sales for investment or other purposes not connected with bona fide farm use encourages the conversion of agricultural land to other uses. The identification of agricultural land for farm use, as provided by law, substantially limits alternative uses of such land and justifies the valuation of that land based on its agricultural production capability. Therefore, it is the declared intent of the Legislative Assembly that bona fide farm properties be assessed for ad valorem property tax purposes at a value that is exclusive of values attributable to urban influences or speculative purposes.

      "text": "Income requirements for nonexclusive farm use zone farmland. (1) For purposes of ORS 308A.050 to 308A.128, farmland or a farm parcel that is not within an area zoned for exclusive farm use is not used exclusively for farm use unless all of the prerequisites of subsections (2) to (5) of this section are met. (2)(a) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, in three out of the five full calendar years immediately preceding the assessment date, the farmland or farm parcel was operated as a part of a farm unit that has produced a gross income from farm uses in the following amount for a calendar year: (A) If the farm unit consists of 6-1/2 acres or less, the gross income from farm use shall be at least $650. (B) If the farm unit consists of more than 6-1/2 acres but less than 30 acres, the gross income from farm use shall be at least equal to the product of $100 times the number of acres and any fraction of an acre of land included. (C) If the farm unit consists of 30 acres or more, the gross income from farm use shall be at least $3,000. (b) For purposes of determining the number of acres to be considered under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the land described in ORS 308A.056 (3) and the land, not exceeding one acre, used as a homestead shall not be included. (c) If a farm parcel is operated as part of a farm unit and the farmland of the farm unit is not all under the same ownership, the gross income requirements applicable to the farm parcel shall be as provided under paragraph (a) of this subsection. In addition, the gross income from farm use of a farm parcel described under this paragraph must be at least: (A) One-half of the gross income requirements described under paragraph (a) of this subsection that would be required if the farm parcel were the only farmland of the farm unit; or (B) A cash or net share crop rental of one-quarter of the gross income requirements described under paragraph (a) of this subsection that would be required if the farm parcel were the only farmland of the farm unit. For purposes of this subparagraph, net share crop rental means the value of any crop received by the owner of the farm parcel less any costs borne by the owner of the farm parcel. (3) Excise or income tax returns are filed with the Department of Revenue for purposes of ORS chapter 316, 317 or 318 by the farmland owner or the operator of the farm unit that include a Schedule F and, if applicable, by the owner of a farm parcel that include a schedule or schedules showing rental income received by the owner of the farm parcel, during the years to which the income requirements of this section apply. (4) Upon request, a copy of the returns or the schedules of the returns showing the gross income received from farm use is furnished by the taxpayer to the county assessor. (5) The burden of proving the gross income of the farm unit for the years described in subsection (2) of this section is upon the person claiming special assessment for the land. (6) The failure of a farm unit to produce the amount of gross income required by subsection (2) of this section shall not prevent the farm unit from meeting the qualifications of this section if: (a) The failure is because: (A) The effect of flooding substantially precludes normal and reasonable farming during the year; or (B) Severe drought conditions are declared under ORS 536.700 to 536.780; and (b) The farm unit produces the required amount of gross income in three out of the last five nonflood or nondrought years. (7) As used in this section: (a) Farm parcel means the contiguous land under the same ownership, whether assessed as one or more than one tax lot. (b) Gross income includes the value of any crop or livestock that is used by the owner personally or in the farming operation of the owner, but does not include: (A) The value of any crop or livestock so used unless records accurately reflecting both value and use of the crop or livestock are kept by the owner in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting principles; and (B) The purchase cost of livestock. (c) Owner or ownership means any person described under ORS 308A.077 (2)(b)(A), (B), (D) or (E) and spouse or other person who is also an owner as tenant in common or other joint ownership interest.",

(2) Following a disqualification listed in subsection (1) of this section, an additional tax shall be added to the tax extended against the land on the next assessment and tax roll, to be collected and distributed in the same manner as other ad valorem property tax moneys. The additional tax shall be equal to the difference between the taxes assessed against the land and the taxes that would otherwise have been assessed against the land, for each of the number of years determined under subsection (3) of this section. (3) The number of years for which additional taxes shall be calculated shall equal the lesser of the number of consecutive years the land had qualified for the special assessment program for which disqualification has occurred or: (a) Ten years, in the case of exclusive farm use zone farmland, but only if the land, immediately following disqualification, remains outside an urban growth boundary; (b) Ten years, in the case of wildlife habitat special assessment land within an exclusive farm use zone, but only if the land, immediately following disqualification, remains outside an urban growth boundary; (c) Ten years, in the case of conservation easement special assessment land within an exclusive farm use zone, but only if the land, immediately following disqualification, remains outside an urban growth boundary; or (d) Five years, in the case of: (A) Nonexclusive farm use zone farmland; (B) Western Oregon designated forestland; (C) Eastern Oregon designated forestland; (D) Exclusive farm use zone farmland that is not described in paragraph (a) of this subsection; (E) Wildlife habitat special assessment land that is not described in paragraph (b) of this subsection; or (F) Conservation easement special assessment land that is not described in paragraph (c) of this subsection. (4)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, if disqualification under subsection (1)(a) or (b) of this section occurs within five years after the end of a period of farm use special assessment pursuant to a remediation plan as defined in ORS 308A.053, the number of years for which the additional tax shall be calculated shall be the number of years determined under subsection (3) of this section plus the number of years during which farm use special assessment was granted pursuant to the remediation plan. (b) Additional tax may not be collected for the number of years during which farm use special assessment was granted pursuant to the remediation plan if the plan: (A) Is implemented in good faith; and (B) Fails to render continued farm use practicable. (5) The additional taxes described in this section shall be deemed assessed and imposed in the year to which the additional taxes relate. (6) If the disqualification of the land is the result of the sale or transfer of the land to an ownership making the land exempt from ad valorem property taxation, the lien for additional taxes shall attach as of the day preceding the sale or transfer. (7) The amount determined to be due under this section may be paid to the tax collector prior to the time of the next general property tax roll, pursuant to the provisions of ORS 311.370.",
