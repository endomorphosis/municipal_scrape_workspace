(1) When the petition for formation of an irrigation district is filed, the county court shall hold the hearing required under ORS 545.025 (6). The county court may adjourn the hearing from time to time, but the hearing shall not be extended over a period exceeding four weeks. At the end of the hearing, the county court may make such changes in the proposed boundaries as the court may find proper, and shall establish and define the boundaries, subject to the following: (a) An irrigation district may not include land that is located within a city or platted subdivision and that is chiefly available for residence purposes. The restriction imposed by this paragraph is expressly limited to residence property, and all lands, whether wholly or partially within any city or platted subdivision, used or suitable for agricultural or horticultural purposes and not platted in tracts of less than one acre, may be included in a district. However, if an irrigation district is formed as a successor district to another water supply entity and if that entity provides water for irrigation to land within any city or platted subdivision, the restriction imposed by this paragraph does not apply to such land that is served by the water supply entity at the time of formation of the irrigation district. (b) The county court shall not modify the boundaries so as to exclude any territory within the boundaries of the district proposed by the petitioners that is susceptible to irrigation by the same system of works applicable to other lands in the proposed district. (c) In the discretion of the county court, an owner of land that is susceptible to irrigation from the same system of works may, upon written application of the owner, have the land included in the district. (2) At the end of the hearing, the county court shall make and enter an order determining whether the requisite number of owners of the land within the proposed district have petitioned for its formation, and whether the notice required under ORS 545.025 (6) has been duly published. (3) If the county court finds that the petition is signed by all of the owners of all of the lands that are included within the proposed district and that will be subject to the charges and assessments of the proposed district and if the only modifications of district boundaries are at the request of owners of land seeking inclusion under subsection (1)(c) of this section, the county court shall enter an order creating the district and the election otherwise required by ORS 545.037 shall not be held. If the petition for formation also names persons desired as members of the first board of directors of the district and those persons have agreed in writing to serve as directors, the order shall declare those persons to be the directors of the district.

However, the judges of election appointed under ORS 545.137 (2) are not required to be in attendance until after 8 p.m. on the day of the election. (4) The secretary of the board of directors for the district shall mail an official ballot with a return identification envelope and a secrecy envelope to an elector, not sooner than the 20th day before the date of the election to be conducted by mail and not later than the 14th day before the election. The secretary shall cause to be placed in or on each return identification envelope a statement to be completed by the elector that says that the elector, under penalty of perjury, swears and affirms that the elector is the sole elector authorized to cast the ballot. In addition, the secretary shall verify that, according to the records of the district as of the 21st day before the election, the elector is entitled to vote. (5) When a ballot is mailed to a corporate landowner, a person authorized to act in a representative capacity or landowners under multiple ownership, the secretary shall enclose voting instructions advising the elector that the voting rights of electors for corporate, representative or multiple ownerships are as described in ORS 545.002. (6) The secretary of the board of directors may not mail voting materials to an elector who actually acquires ownership of land within the district after the 21st day before the date of an election. When an elector has acquired ownership of land within the district after the 21st day before the date of an election, the secretary shall make voting materials available, and the elector may vote, only at the district office or at another place designated by the board. (7) When the elector is an elector described in subsection (6) of this section, the secretary of the board of directors shall, before making voting materials available, require that the elector file with the district a copy of a recorded deed or a memorandum of contract demonstrating the acquisition of land by the elector within the district. The secretary shall then allow the elector to mark the ballot, sign the return identification envelope and return the ballot in the return identification envelope to the secretary. (8) An elector may obtain a replacement ballot if the original ballot is destroyed, spoiled, lost or not received by the elector. The secretary shall keep a record of each replacement ballot provided to an elector. An elector may obtain a replacement ballot and may vote at the district office or another place within the district designated by the board of directors on the actual date of the election, during the hours designated in ORS 545.139. (9) Until the time for the close of the polls, an elector may obtain a replacement ballot from the secretary of the board of directors, at a place designated by the board, if the original ballot is destroyed, spoiled, lost or not received by the elector. (10) When an elector receives vote by mail materials, the elector shall comply with all written instructions provided, mark the ballot, sign both the return identification envelope and the sworn statement of entitlement to vote and return the marked ballot to the district by placing the ballot in the return identification envelope and either depositing the envelope in the United States mail or delivering the sealed envelope to the district office or another place designated by the district. (11) A completed ballot must be received by the district, at the proper place designated by the district, no later than 8 p.m. on the day of the election. (12) A ballot shall be counted only if: (a) The ballot was returned in the sealed return identification envelope provided by the district; (b) The elector signed the return identification envelope; and (c) The secretary of the board of directors has verified the name of the elector and the electors ownership of land within the district. (13) Using the records of the district, the secretary shall verify the name and land ownership of each elector.

The lien shall be a continuing one and shall bind the crops after, as well as before, they have been gathered. The lien shall be preferred to all other liens or encumbrances upon the crops, except mortgages given to the state for the purchase of seed wheat. (2) The person or irrigation district so supplying water, within 40 days after the water has been furnished, or within 40 days after the close of the irrigation season, shall file with the county clerk of the county in which the lands, or some part of the lands, are situated and where the water has been furnished, a claim containing a true statement of the account due for the water after deducting all just credits and offsets.

(3) The lien may be enforced by a suit in equity. The remedy provided by this section does not abrogate any other remedy provided by law for the collection of dues, charges or assessment for water furnished. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to a person or irrigation district if the person or district prevails in an action to foreclose a lien under this section. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to a defendant who prevails in an action to foreclose a lien under this section if the court determines that the plaintiff had no objectively reasonable basis for asserting the claim or no reasonable basis for appealing an adverse decision of the trial court. (4) If all or part of the crop is sold prior to the filing of the lien, or possession delivered to an agent, broker, cooperative agency or other person to be sold or otherwise disposed of, and its identity lost or destroyed or if the crop is commingled with like crops so that it cannot be segregated, and if the purchaser, agent, broker, cooperative agency or other person was notified of the filing of the lien by being furnished with a certified copy of the claim of lien, then the lien attaches to the proceeds of sale remaining in the possession of the purchaser, agent, broker, cooperative agency or other person at the time of the notice.

(2) After making the determination required by subsection (1) of this section the board of directors may, as a condition for the delivery of water and the charging or assessment of the lands, require that the applicants contract to pay to the district such sums as the board determines. However, these sums shall not exceed the amount the applicants or their predecessors in interest would have been required to pay to the district for charges and assessments for the payment of their pro rata share of all bonds previously issued and the interest on the bonds, or other indebtedness incurred by the district, had such lands been included in the district when such bonds were issued or such indebtedness incurred. However, there shall be credited to these sums any amount previously paid on behalf of these lands on the bonds or indebtedness. (3) The charges made under subsection (2) of this section shall be set forth in the order allowing the inclusion of the lands in the district. A certified copy of the order shall be recorded in the same manner as provided by ORS 545.079 and the charges and assessments paid, collected and enforced as provided by that section. (4) For the purposes of this section the summit of the Cascade Mountains is considered to be a line beginning at the intersection of the western boundary of Hood River County with the northern boundary of the State of Oregon, thence southerly along the western boundaries of the counties of Hood River, Wasco, Jefferson, Deschutes and Klamath to the southern boundary of the State of Oregon.

When making the computation, the board shall consider the amounts of money necessary for: (a) The care, operation and maintenance of district facilities; (b) Reasonable reserve funds for major maintenance, improvement and replacement of capital improvements and facilities; (c) The acquisition of land or water rights; (d) Bond or interest payments, or payments due or to become due to the United States or the State of Oregon under any contract of the district with the United States or the State of Oregon; or (e) Other expenses of the district. (2) The resolution shall fix the time when the incurred charge becomes due and payable. The resolution shall also fix a time, within one year after the date the incurred charge becomes due and payable, after which the incurred charge becomes delinquent. (3) The amount determined by the board shall be apportioned by the board to the lands owned or held by each person so that each acre of land in the district that is entitled to irrigation is required to pay the same amount, except as otherwise provided in ORS 545.385, 545.387, 545.389, 545.391 and 545.487. Land owned by a person constituting a fractional portion of an acre may be rounded to the next higher whole acre. (4) A district that provides drainage or other services to lands that are not entitled to irrigation services from the district may, at the discretion of the districts board of directors, charge a different fee for the provision of those services. (5) The annual incurred charges established by the resolution shall continue in effect from year to year until changed by a resolution of the board of directors. (6) A person is deemed to have requested water and other services and improvements provided by the district if the person signed a petition requesting the formation of an irrigation district under ORS 545.025, requested that the land of the person be included in the district pursuant to ORS 545.057 or paid an incurred charge on or before the delinquency date fixed by the resolution and the person has not: (a) Excluded the land from the district pursuant to ORS 545.099; (b) Transferred all water rights from the land pursuant to ORS 540.505 to 540.585 for the period of time that the incurred charge was incurred; or (c) Otherwise requested that water and other services and improvements no longer be provided to the land. (7) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, if a person was denied approval to transfer all water rights from the land pursuant to ORS 540.523 or 540.530 or another provision for the period of time that the incurred charge was incurred, the district may assess an incurred charge against the person only if the incurred charge is based on the actual quantity of water used by the person.",
