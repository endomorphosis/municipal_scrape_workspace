(1)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, after returning to work after a period of family leave, medical leave or safe leave, an eligible employee is entitled to be restored to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced, if that position still exists, without regard to whether the employer filled the position with a replacement worker during the period of leave. If the position held by the employee at the time leave commenced no longer exists, the employee is entitled to be restored to any available equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay and other terms and conditions of employment. If an equivalent position is not available at the job site of the employees former position, the employer shall offer the employee an equivalent position at a job site located within 50 miles of the job site of the employees former position, if such a position is available. If equivalent positions are available at multiple job sites, the employer shall first offer the employee the position at the job site that is nearest to the job site of the employees former position. (b) For employers that employ fewer than 25 employees, if the position held by an eligible employee when the employees leave commenced no longer exists, an employer may, at the employers discretion based on business necessity, restore the eligible employee to a different position with similar job duties and with the same employment benefits and pay. (2)(a) During a period in which an eligible employee takes leave described under subsection (1) of this section, the employer shall maintain any health care benefits the employee had prior to taking such leave for the duration of the leave, as if the employee had continued in employment continuously during the period of leave. The employee must continue to make any regular contributions to the cost of the health insurance premiums. (b) Notwithstanding ORS 652.610 (3) and except as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, if the employer is required or elects to pay any part of the costs of providing disability, life or other insurance coverage for an eligible employee during the period of family leave that should have been paid by the employee, the employer may deduct from the employees pay such amounts upon the employees return to work until the amount the employer advanced toward the payments is paid. In no event may the total amount deducted for insurance under the provisions of this subsection exceed 10 percent of the employees gross pay each period. (3) An eligible employee who has taken leave described under subsection (1) of this section does not lose any employment benefits, including seniority or pension rights, accrued before the date on which the leave commenced. (4) It is an unlawful employment practice to discriminate against an eligible employee who has invoked any provision of this chapter. (5) Nothing in this section entitles an eligible employee to accrue employment benefits during a period of leave or to a right, benefit or position of employment other than a right, benefit or position to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee not taken leave. (6)(a) Nothing in this section requires an employer to retain a temporary worker who was hired to replace an eligible employee taking family leave, medical leave or safe leave after the eligible employee has returned to work. (b) A civil action may not be brought against an employer for taking any of the following actions necessary to restore an eligible employee to the position of employment held by the employee as required under subsection (1) of this section: (A) Terminating the employment of a worker who was hired solely to temporarily replace an eligible employee during a period of leave; or (B) Removing an employee from a position to which the employee was transferred to temporarily replace an eligible employee while the eligible employee was on leave, and returning the employee to the position originally held by the employee prior to the transfer at the salary or rate of pay and benefits associated with the position. (c) An employer shall, either at the time of hire or before reassignment, inform a temporary worker or an employee who is reassigned to a position to temporarily replace an eligible employee during a period of leave of the information provided under this subsection. (7) The protections provided under this section apply only to an eligible employee who was employed by the employer for at least 90 days before taking leave described under subsection (1) of this section.

(1)(a) An employer may apply to the Director of the Employment Department for approval of an employer-offered benefit plan that provides family and medical leave insurance benefits to the employers employees. (b) An employer that seeks approval of a plan shall submit an application to the director in the form and manner prescribed by the director by rule, accompanied by an application fee not to exceed $250. (2) The director shall review and approve an application for a plan if the director finds that: (a) The plan is made available to all employees who have been continuously employed with an employer for 30 days. (b) The benefits afforded to employees covered under the plan are equal to or greater than the weekly benefits and the duration of leave that an eligible employee would qualify for under this chapter. (3) An employer may make a plan available to employees who have been employed by the employer for less than 30 days but in no event may an employer require an employee to have been employed by the employer for more than 30 days to be eligible for coverage under the plan. (4) Neither an employer that provides benefits under an approved plan nor an employee covered under such a plan is required to make the contributions under ORS 657B.150. (5)(a) An employer may assume all or a part of the costs related to a plan approved under this section. (b) If an employer assumes only part of the costs, the employer may deduct employee contributions from the wages of employees to finance the costs related to the plan, except that any contribution amounts deducted may not exceed the amount that an employee would otherwise be required to contribute under ORS 657B.150. (c) Employee contributions received or retained by an employer under this subsection must be used for plan expenses and are not considered to be a part of an employers assets for any purpose. (6) Any paid sick leave earned under ORS 653.606 is in addition to the benefits made available under a plan that has been approved under this section. (7) An employee who takes leave pursuant to a plan approved under this section shall provide notice to an employer of such leave in the same manner as provided in ORS 657B.040. (8) A plan approved under this section shall remain in effect for a period of not less than one year. (9) Nothing in this section prohibits an employee who is otherwise eligible from applying for coverage under the program established under ORS 657B.340 or under a separate employer-offered plan that has been approved under this section. (10) The director shall adopt rules that require that the benefits made available to an eligible employee who is covered under more than one plan shall be prorated under each respective plan. (11) An employer that offers a plan approved under this section shall: (a) Be subject to the same requirements provided in ORS 657B.060 and 657B.070; (b) Maintain all reports, information and records relating to the plan, including payroll and account records that document employee contributions and expenses, in the manner established by the director by rule; and (c) Provide written notice to employees that includes: (A) Information about benefits available under the approved plan, including the duration of leave; (B) The process for filing a claim to receive benefits under the plan; (C) The process for employee deductions used to finance the costs of the plan, if any; (D) An employees right to dispute a benefit determination in the manner determined by the director under ORS 657B.420; (E) The right to job protection and benefits continuation, if applicable; and (F) A statement that discrimination and retaliatory personnel actions against an employee for inquiring about the family and medical leave insurance program established under ORS 657B.340, giving notification of leave under the program, taking leave under the program or claiming family and medical leave insurance benefits are prohibited. (12) Benefits received under this section are considered wages for purposes of a wage claim under ORS chapter 652. (13) An employer whose application for plan approval was denied by the director under this section or terminated by the director under ORS 657B.220 may request review of the decision as provided in ORS 657B.410.

(1) An employer may not willfully make or cause to be made false statements or willfully fail to report a material fact regarding the claim of an eligible employee or regarding an employees eligibility for family and medical leave insurance benefits under this chapter. (2) The Director of the Employment Department may assess a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $1,000 against an employer for each occurrence that violates subsection (1) of this section. (3) If the director determines that a covered individual willfully made a false statement or willfully failed to report a material fact in order to obtain benefits under this chapter, the covered individual is: (a) Disqualified from claiming benefits for one year; and (b) Liable for a penalty imposed at a rate prescribed by the director of at least 15 percent, but not greater than 30 percent, of the amount of benefits the covered individual received to which the covered individual was not entitled. (4)(a) If the director determines that a covered individual has received benefits to which the covered individual was not entitled, the director may: (A) Seek repayment of benefits from the covered individual in a manner prescribed by the director by rule; or (B) Have the amount of the benefits deducted from any future benefits otherwise payable to the covered individual under ORS 657B.100. (b) For purposes of paragraph (a)(B) of this subsection, the director may deduct all or any part of the covered individuals future weekly benefits. (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection, benefits described in paragraph (a) of this subsection may be collected for any week or weeks within five years following the week in which the decision establishing the erroneous payment became final. (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this subsection, overpaid benefits subject to the penalty imposed under subsection (3)(b) of this section may be collected at any time. (e) Notice provided to a covered individual of the covered individuals liability for recovery of benefits under this section must include a description of: (A) The basis for the directors decision that benefits have been overpaid; and (B) The consequences of the overpayment, including the methods of recovery of the overpaid amount, with interest and penalties, and the possibility of waiver under ORS 657B.336. (5) If benefits are paid because of an error that is not due to provision of a false statement, nondisclosure of a material fact or misrepresentation by a covered individual, the director may waive, in whole or in part, the amount of any such payments for which recovery under subsection (4) of this section would be against equity, good conscience or administrative efficiency. (6) A decision of the director under this section does not authorize the recovery of the amount of any benefits paid to a covered individual until the decision is final and the decision specifies: (a) That the covered individual, by reason of false statement, nondisclosure or misrepresentation, is liable to repay the amount to the Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance Fund established under ORS 657B.430; (b) The nature of the false statement, nondisclosure or misrepresentation; (c) The week or weeks for which the benefits were paid; and (d) That any amount subject to recovery and any penalty due under this section may be collected by the director in a civil action against the employer or covered individual brought in the name of the director. (7)(a) The director may bring a civil action against a covered individual to collect any amount subject to recovery and any penalty due under this section. (b) Any judgment rendered shall bear interest at the rate provided in subsection (8) of this section. (8) Interest on any amount liable to be repaid under this section shall be paid and collected at the same time repayment of benefits is made by the covered individual, at the rate of one percent per month. In computing the interest, a fraction of a month shall be counted as a full month. (9)(a) Deductions from paid family and medical leave insurance benefits pursuant to subsection (4) of this section shall be applied solely to the amount of the benefits liable to be repaid under this section.

(b) Notwithstanding subsection (5) of this section, if the report is subsequently found to be incorrect, additional assessments may be made. (2) If an employer fails to file a report when required by the director for the purpose of determining the amount of contributions due under ORS 657B.150, the director may make an estimate based upon any information of the amount of the wages of the employers employees for the period or periods for which no report was filed and upon the basis of the estimate shall compute and assess the amount of contributions payable by the employer.

(b)(A) Interest shall not begin to accrue on contributions collected under paragraph (a) of this subsection until the due date. (B) Court costs may not be charged against an employer or an individual liable under ORS 657B.330 on any action to enforce collection commenced prior to the due date.

(d) Written notice of an assessment to an employer or an individual liable under ORS 657B.330 shall be mailed to the employers or individuals last known address of record with the director.
