(1) This chapter is enacted to enable the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services to promulgate a state building code to govern the construction, reconstruction, alteration and repair of buildings and other structures and the installation of mechanical devices and equipment therein, and to require the correction of unsafe conditions caused by earthquakes in existing buildings. The state building code shall establish uniform performance standards providing reasonable safeguards for health, safety, welfare, comfort and security of the residents of this state who are occupants and users of buildings, and will provide for the use of modern methods, devices, materials, techniques and practicable maximum energy conservation. (2) The rules adopted pursuant to this chapter shall include structural standards; standards for the installation and use of mechanical, heating and ventilating devices and equipment; and standards for prefabricated structures; and shall, subject to ORS 455.210, prescribe reasonable fees for the issuance of building permits and similar documents, inspections and plan review services by the Department of Consumer and Business Services. The department may also establish, by rule, the amount of any fee pertaining to the state building code or any specialty code that is authorized by statute, but for which an amount is not specified by statute. (3) This chapter does not affect the statutory jurisdiction and authority of the Workers Compensation Board, under ORS chapter 654, to promulgate occupational safety and health standards relating to places of employment, and to administer and enforce all state laws, regulations, rules, standards and lawful orders requiring places of employment to be safe and healthful. (4) This chapter and any specialty code does not limit the authority of a municipality to enact regulations providing for local administration of the state building code; local appeal boards; fees and other charges; abatement of nuisances and dangerous buildings; enforcement through penalties, stop-work orders or other means; or minimum health, sanitation and safety standards for governing the use of structures for housing, except where the power of municipalities to enact any such regulations is expressly withheld or otherwise provided for by statute. Pursuant to the regulation of dangerous buildings, a municipality may adopt seismic rehabilitation plans that provide for phased completion of repairs that are designed to provide improved life safety but that may be less than the standards for new buildings.",

(2)(a) In addition to the notice requirements of ORS 183.335, notice of a public hearing on adoption, amendment or repeal of a specialty code shall be given to the governing bodies of all municipalities and the Department of Early Learning and Care for any specialty code that may affect a child care provider. Notice shall state that copies of the proposed action may be obtained from the department. (b) The notice of proposed rule change shall include a finding by the advisory board that the added cost, if any, is necessary to the health and safety of the occupants or the public or necessary to conserve scarce resources. (c) The director shall maintain a roster of individuals who wish to be notified of any changes to or interpretations of the Low-Rise Residential Dwelling Code. Subscribers to the list may be charged a reasonable amount necessary to defray the cost of maintaining the list and advising the subscribers of changes in the code. (3) The director is not required to publish or distribute those parts of a specialty code of regulations adopted by reference. However, the director shall publish with a specialty code and annually thereafter a list of places where copies of those parts of the specialty code adopted by reference may be obtained together with the approximate cost thereof. The director shall file one copy of the rule with the Secretary of State. All standards referred to in any specialty code or any of the modifications thereto need not be so filed. All standards and specialty codes referred to in the specialty code shall be kept on file and available for inspection in the offices of the department. (4) Any interested person may propose amendments to the state building code, which proposed amendments may be either applicable to all municipalities or, where it is alleged and established that conditions exist within a municipality or some municipalities that are not generally found within other municipalities, amendments may be restricted in application to such municipalities. Amendments proposed to the state building code under this subsection shall be in conformity with the policy and purpose prescribed by ORS 455.020. The justification and the particular circumstances requiring the proposed amendments shall be fully stated in the proposal. The director shall submit all proposed amendments to the appropriate advisory board. The board shall review and report its recommendations to the director on the amendments within 180 days after the date of submission by the director. (5) The director, with the approval of the advisory board, may adopt or modify and adopt any amendments proposed to the director under subsection (4) of this section. The director shall, within 30 days after the date of receipt of the recommendations of the advisory board, notify the person proposing the amendments of the adoption, modification and adoption or denial of the proposed amendments. Upon adoption, a copy of each amendment shall be distributed to the governing bodies of all municipalities affected thereby.

(2) A municipality that administers a building inspection program as allowed under this section shall do so for periods of four years. The Department of Consumer and Business Services shall adopt rules to adjust time periods for administration of a building inspection program to allow for variations in the needs of the department and participants. (3)(a) If a municipality administers a building inspection program, the governing body of the municipality shall, unless other means are already provided, appoint or employ a person to serve as a building official, who will administer and enforce the building inspection program. Under the circumstances described in ORS 455.202 (2), a municipality may for the same purpose enter into a contract with a contract building official, as defined in ORS 455.202. A building official or contract building official shall, in the municipality that appointed or employed the building official or that contracted with the contract building official, attend to all aspects of code enforcement, including the issuance of all building permits. Two or more municipalities may combine in the appointment of a single building official or in a contract for a single contract building official for the purpose of administering a building inspection program within each municipality. (b) A contract between a municipality and a contract building official is subject to applicable provisions of ORS chapters 279A, 279B and 279C. (4)(a) By January 1 of the year preceding the expiration of the four-year period described in subsection (2) of this section, the governing body of the municipality shall notify the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services and, if the municipality is not a county, notify the county whether the municipality will continue to administer and enforce the building inspection program after expiration of the four-year period. (b) Notwithstanding the January 1 date set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the director and the municipality and, if the municipality is not a county, the county may by agreement extend that date to no later than March 1. (5) If a city does not notify the director, or notifies the director that the city will not administer the building inspection program, the county or counties within which the city is located shall administer and enforce the county program within the city in the same manner as the program is administered and enforced outside the city, except as provided by subsection (6) of this section. (6) If a county does not notify the director, or notifies the director that the county will not administer and enforce a building inspection program, the director shall contract with a municipality or other person or use such state employees or state agencies as are necessary to administer and enforce a building inspection program, and permit or other fees arising from the building inspection program must be paid into the Consumer and Business Services Fund created by ORS 705.145 and credited to the account responsible for paying the expenses of the department related to administering and enforcing the building inspection program. A state employee may not be displaced as a result of using contract personnel. (7) The governing body of a municipality may commence responsibility for the administration and enforcement of a building inspection program beginning July 1 of any year by notifying the director no later than January 1 of the same year and obtaining the directors approval of an assumption plan as described in subsection (11)(c) of this section. (8) The department shall adopt rules to require the governing body of each municipality assuming or continuing a building inspection program under this section to submit a written plan with the notice required under subsection (4) or (7) of this section.

The plan must specify how cooperation with the State Fire Marshal or a designee of the State Fire Marshal will be achieved and how a uniform fire code will be considered in the review process of the design and construction phases of buildings or structures. (9) A municipality that administers and enforces a building inspection program pursuant to this section shall recognize and accept the performances of state building code activities by businesses and persons authorized under ORS 455.457 to perform the activities as if the activities were performed by the municipality. A municipality is not required to accept an inspection, a plan or a plan review that does not meet the requirements of the state building code. (10) The department or a municipality that accepts an inspection or plan review as required by this section by a person licensed under ORS 455.457 has no responsibility or liability for the activities of the licensee. (11) In addition to the requirements of ORS 455.100 and 455.110, the director shall regulate building inspection programs that municipalities assume on or after January 1, 2002. Regulation under this subsection must include but not be limited to: (a) Creating building inspection program application and amendment requirements and procedures; (b) Granting or denying applications for building inspection program authority and amendments; (c) Requiring a municipality assuming a building inspection program to submit with the notice given under subsection (7) of this section an assumption plan that includes, at a minimum: (A) A description of the intended availability of program services, including proposed service agreements for carrying out the program during at least the first two years; (B) Demonstration of the ability and intent to provide building inspection program services for at least two years; (C) An estimate of proposed permit revenue and program operating expenses; (D) Proposed staffing levels; and (E) Proposed service levels; (d) Reviewing procedures and program operations of municipalities; (e) Creating standards for efficient, effective, timely and acceptable building inspection programs; (f) Creating standards for justifying increases in building inspection program fees adopted by a municipality; (g) Creating standards for determining whether a county or department building inspection program is economically impaired because of the countys or the departments inability to reasonably continue providing the program throughout a county, if another municipality is allowed to provide a building inspection program within the same county; and (h) Enforcing the requirements of this section. (12) The department may assume administration and enforcement of a building inspection program: (a) During the pendency of activities under ORS 455.770; (b) If a municipality abandons or is no longer able to administer the building inspection program; or (c) If a municipality fails to substantially comply with any provision of this section or of ORS 455.465, 455.467 and 455.469. (13) If the department assumes the administration and enforcement of a building inspection program under this section, in addition to any other power granted to the director, the director may: (a) Enter into agreements with local governments under ORS 455.185 regarding the administration and enforcement of the assumed building inspection program; (b) Take action as described in ORS 455.192 to ensure that sufficient staff and other resources are available for the administration and enforcement of the assumed building inspection program; (c) Charge fees described in ORS 455.195 for department services provided in administering and enforcing the assumed building inspection program; and (d) Ratify or disapprove the discretionary decisions of a contract building official, as both terms are defined in ORS 455.202, to the extent that a municipality could ratify or disapprove the discretionary decisions of the municipalitys contract building official. (14) A municipality that abandons or otherwise ceases to administer and enforce a building inspection program that the municipality assumed under this section may not resume the administration or enforcement of the program for at least two years. The municipality may resume the administration and enforcement of the abandoned program only on July 1 of an odd-numbered year. Prior to resuming the administration and enforcement of the program, the municipality must follow the notification procedure set forth in subsection (7) of this section.

(3)(a) If a municipality administers a building inspection program, the governing body of the municipality shall, unless other means are already provided, appoint or employ a person to serve as a building official, who will administer and enforce all or parts of the building inspection program. Under the circumstances described in ORS 455.202 (2), a municipality may for the same purpose enter into a contract with a contract building official, as defined in ORS 455.202. A building official or contract building official shall, in the municipality that appointed or employed the building official or contracted with the contract building official, attend to all aspects of code enforcement, including the issuance of all building permits. Two or more municipalities may combine in the appointment of a single building official or in a contract with a single contract building official for the purpose of administering a building inspection program within each municipality. (b) A contract between a municipality and a contract building official is subject to applicable provisions of ORS chapters 279A, 279B and 279C. (4)(a) By January 1 of the year preceding the expiration of the four-year period described in subsection (2) of this section, the governing body of the municipality shall notify the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services and, if not a county, notify the county whether the municipality will continue to administer all or part of the building inspection program after the four-year period expires. If parts of a building inspection program are to be administered and enforced by a municipality, the parts shall correspond to a classification designated by the director as reasonable divisions of work. (b) Notwithstanding the January 1 date set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the director and the municipality and, if the municipality is not a county, the county may by agreement extend that date to no later than March 1. (5) If a city does not notify the director, or notifies the director that the city will not administer all or parts of certain specialty codes under the building inspection program, the county or counties within which the city is located shall administer and enforce those codes or parts of the codes within the city in the same manner as the county or counties administer and enforce the codes or parts of the codes outside the city, except as provided by subsection (6) of this section. (6) If a county does not notify the director, or notifies the director that the county will not administer and enforce all or parts of certain specialty codes under the building inspection program, the director shall contract with a municipality or other person or use such state employees or state agencies as are necessary to administer and enforce those codes or parts of the codes, and permit or other fees arising from the administration and enforcement must be paid into the Consumer and Business Services Fund created by ORS 705.145 and credited to the account responsible for paying such expenses. A state employee may not be displaced as a result of using contract personnel. (7) If a municipality administering a building inspection program under this section seeks to administer additional parts of a program, the municipality must comply with ORS 455.148, including the requirement that the municipality administer and enforce all aspects of the building inspection program. Thereafter, the municipality is subject to ORS 455.148 and ceases to be subject to this section. (8) The department shall adopt rules to require the governing body of each municipality to submit a written plan with the notice required under subsection (4) of this section. If the department is the governing body, the department shall have a plan on file. The plan shall specify how cooperation with the State Fire Marshal or a designee of the State Fire Marshal will be achieved and how a uniform fire code will be considered in the review process of the design and construction phases of buildings or structures. (9) A municipality that administers a code for which persons or businesses are authorized under ORS 455.457 to perform activities shall recognize and accept those activities as if performed by the municipality. A municipality is not required to accept an inspection, a plan or a plan review that does not meet the requirements of the state building code. (10) The department or a municipality that accepts an inspection or plan review as required by this section by a person licensed under ORS 455.457 has no responsibility or liability for the activities of the licensee. (11) In addition to the requirements of ORS 455.100 and 455.110, the director shall regulate building inspection programs of municipalities assumed prior to January 1, 2002. Regulation under this subsection must include but not be limited to: (a) Creating building inspection program application and amendment requirements and procedures; (b) Granting or denying applications for building inspection program authority and amendments; (c) Reviewing procedures and program operations of municipalities; (d) Creating standards for efficient, effective, timely and acceptable building inspection programs; (e) Creating standards for justifying increases in building inspection program fees adopted by a municipality; (f) Creating standards for determining whether a county or department building inspection program is economically impaired because of the countys or the departments inability to reasonably continue providing the program or part of the program throughout a county, if another municipality is allowed to provide a building inspection program or part of a program within the same county; and (g) Enforcing the requirements of this section. (12) The department may assume administration and enforcement of a building inspection program: (a) During the pendency of activities under ORS 455.770; (b) If a municipality abandons any part of the building inspection program or is no longer able to administer the building inspection program; or (c) If a municipality fails to substantially comply with any provision of this section or of ORS 455.465, 455.467 and 455.469. (13) If the department assumes the administration and enforcement of a building inspection program under this section, in addition to any other power granted to the director, the director may: (a) Enter into agreements with local governments under ORS 455.185 regarding the administration and enforcement of the assumed building inspection program; (b) Take action as described in ORS 455.192 to ensure that sufficient staff and other resources are available for the administration and enforcement of the assumed building inspection program; (c) Charge fees described in ORS 455.195 for department services provided in administering and enforcing the assumed building inspection program; and (d) Ratify or disapprove the discretionary decisions of a contract building official, as both terms are defined in ORS 455.202, to the extent that a municipality could ratify or disapprove the discretionary decisions of the municipalitys contract building official. (14) If a municipality abandons or otherwise ceases to administer all or part of a building inspection program described in this section, the municipality may not resume the administration and enforcement of the abandoned program or part of a program for at least two years. The municipality may resume the administration and enforcement of the abandoned program or part of a program only on July 1 of an odd-numbered year. To resume the administration and enforcement of the abandoned program or part of a program, the municipality must comply with ORS 455.148, including the requirement that the municipality administer and enforce all aspects of the building inspection program. Thereafter, the municipality is subject to ORS 455.148 and ceases to be subject to this section. (15) A municipality that administers and enforces a building inspection program under this section shall include in the program the inspection of boilers and pressure vessels described in subsection (1)(a)(H) of this section.",

(b) A municipality that establishes a building inspection program under ORS 455.148 or an electrical inspection program under ORS 455.150 covering installations under the electrical specialty code, the Low-Rise Residential Dwelling Code or the Small Home Specialty Code may act on behalf of the Electrical and Elevator Board to investigate violations of and enforce ORS 479.550 (1) and 479.620 and to issue notices of proposed assessment of civil penalties for those violations. (c) A municipality that establishes a building inspection program under ORS 455.148 or 455.150 may investigate violations and enforce any provisions of the program administered by the municipality.

This subsection does not prohibit a municipality from charging a violator an increased permit fee or investigative fee, seeking injunctive relief from a violation or taking any enforcement action that does not include a monetary penalty. This subsection does not limit the terms or conditions of any voluntary agreement for the resolution of a violation. (3) A municipality may not assess a civil penalty for a violation under a building inspection program unless the municipality provides to the party that is subject to the civil penalty: (a) Notice that: (A) Describes the alleged violation, including any relevant code provision numbers, ordinance numbers or other identifying references; (B) States that the municipality intends to assess a civil penalty for the violation and states the amount of the civil penalty; (C) States that the party may challenge the assessment of a civil penalty; and (D) Describes the means and the deadline for informing the municipality that the party is challenging the assessment of the civil penalty; and (b) A municipal administrative process other than a judicial proceeding in a court of law, that affords the party an opportunity to challenge the civil penalty assessment before an individual, department or body that is other than the municipalitys building inspector or building official. (4) If the municipality assesses a civil penalty for a violation under a building inspection program, the amount of the civil penalty assessed for the violation may not exceed the maximum civil penalty amount authorized for an equivalent specialty code violation under ORS 455.895.

A municipality shall give the director notice of the proposed adoption of a new or increased fee under this subsection.

The persons or association must file the appeal no later than 60 days after the director receives notice of the proposed adoption of the fee from the municipality under paragraph (a) of this subsection. However, if the municipality failed to give notice to the director, an appeal may be filed with the director within one year after adoption of the new or increased fee. Upon receiving a timely appeal, the director shall, after notice to affected parties and hearing, review the municipalitys fee adoption process and the costs of administering and enforcing the specialty code or codes referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection. The director shall approve the fee if the director feels the fee is necessary and reasonable. If the director does not approve the fee upon appeal, the fee is not effective.

(d) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this subsection, in determining whether a fee is reasonable the director shall consider whether: (A) The fee is the same amount as or closely approximates the amount of the fee charged by other municipalities of a similar size and geographic location for the same level of service; (B) The fee is calculated with the same or a similar calculation method as the fee charged by other municipalities for the same service; (C) The fee is the same type as the fee charged by other municipalities for the same level of service; and (D) The municipality, in adopting the fee, complied with ORS 294.160, 294.361 and 294.426 and this section and standards adopted by the director under ORS",

(c) Major structure means a building over six stories in height with an aggregate floor area of 60,000 square feet or more, every building over 10 stories in height and parking structures as determined by Department of Consumer and Business Services rule. (d) Seismic hazard means a geologic condition that is a potential danger to life and property that includes but is not limited to earthquake, landslide, liquefaction, tsunami inundation, fault displacement, and subsidence. (2) The Department of Consumer and Business Services shall consult with the Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission and the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries prior to adopting rules. Thereafter, the Department of Consumer and Business Services may adopt rules as set forth in ORS 183.325 to 183.410 to amend the state building code to: (a) Require new building sites to be evaluated on a site specific basis for vulnerability to seismic geologic hazards if the sites are for structures that are: (A) Major structures; or (B) Designated under subsection (5) of this section as Tsunami Risk Category III or IV for design. (b) Require a program for the installation of strong motions accelerographs in or near selected major buildings. (c) Provide for the review of geologic and engineering reports for seismic design of new major structures or buildings that have been designated under subsection (5) of this section as Tsunami Risk Category III and IV for design. (d) Provide for filing of noninterpretive seismic data from site evaluation in a manner accessible to the public. (3) For the purpose of defraying the cost of applying the regulations in subsection (2) of this section, there is hereby imposed a surcharge in the amount of one percent of the total fees collected under the structural and mechanical specialty codes for major structures and buildings that have been designated under subsection (5) of this section as Tsunami Risk Category III or IV for design, which fees are retained by the jurisdiction enforcing the particular specialty code as provided in ORS 455.150 or enforcing a building inspection program under ORS 455.148. (4) Before submitting design plans for a proposed building designated under subsection (5) of this section as Tsunami Risk Category III or IV for design, the developer shall request consultation from the State Department of Geology and Mineral Industries with respect to the impacts from potential tsunami activity on the proposed building and the department shall provide the developer with the best available scientific evidence of potential impacts.

(1) An applicant for a building permit may appeal a decision made by a building official under authority established pursuant to ORS 455.148, 455.150 or 455.467. The following apply to an appeal under this subsection: (a) An appeal regarding the interpretation or application of a particular specialty code provision shall be made first to the appropriate specialty code chief inspector of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. The decision of the department chief inspector may be appealed to the appropriate advisory board. The decision of the advisory board may only be appealed to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services if codes in addition to the applicable specialty code are at issue. (b) If the appropriate advisory board determines that a decision by the department chief inspector is a major code interpretation, then the inspector shall distribute the decision in writing to all applicable specialty code public and private inspection authorities in the state. The decision shall be distributed within 60 days after the boards determination, and there shall be no charge for the distribution of the decision. As used in this paragraph, a major code interpretation means a code interpretation decision that affects or may affect more than one job site or more than one inspection jurisdiction. (2) Except as provided in subsection (1) of this section, an applicant for a building permit may appeal the decision of a building official on any matter relating to the administration and enforcement of this chapter to the department. The appeal must be in writing. A decision by the department on an appeal filed under this subsection is subject to judicial review as provided in ORS 183.484. (3) If an appeal is made under this section, an inspection authority shall extend the plan review deadline by the number of days it takes for a final decision to be issued for the appeal.

The code provisions for plumbing and electrical requirements must be compatible with other specialty codes adopted by the director. The Electrical and Elevator Board, the Mechanical Board and the State Plumbing Board shall review, respectively, amendments to the electrical, mechanical or plumbing provisions of the code. (2) Changes or amendments to the code adopted under subsection (1) of this section may be made when: (a) Required by geographic or climatic conditions unique to Oregon; (b) Necessary to be compatible with other statutory provisions; (c) Changes to the national codes are adopted in Oregon; or (d) Necessary to authorize the use of building materials and techniques that are consistent with nationally recognized standards and building practices. (3) Notwithstanding ORS 455.030, 455.035, 455.110 and 455.112, the director may, at any time following appropriate consultation with the Mechanical Board or Building Codes Structures Board, amend the mechanical specialty code or structural specialty code to ensure compatibility with the Low-Rise Residential Dwelling Code.

(5) The Low-Rise Residential Dwelling Code shall be adopted and amended as provided by ORS 455.030 and 455.110. (6) The director, by rule, shall establish uniform standards for a municipality to allow an alternate method of construction to the requirements for one and two family dwellings built to the Low-Rise Residential Dwelling Code or Small Home Specialty Code in areas where the local jurisdiction determines that the fire apparatus means of approach to a property or water supply serving a property does not meet applicable fire code or state building code requirements. The alternate method of construction, which may include but is not limited to the installation of automatic fire sprinkler systems, must be approved in conjunction with the approval of an application under ORS 197.522. (7) For lots of record existing before July 2, 2001, or property that receives any approval for partition, subdivision or construction under ORS 197.522 before July 2, 2001, a municipality allowing an alternate method of construction to the requirements for one and two family dwellings built to the Low-Rise Residential Dwelling Code or Small Home Specialty Code may apply the uniform standards established by the director pursuant to subsection (6) of this section.

(8) The director, by rule, shall establish uniform standards for a municipality to allow alternate approval of construction related to conversions of single-family dwellings into no more than four residential dwelling units built to the Low-Rise Residential Dwelling Code that received occupancy approval prior to January 1, 2020. The standards established under this subsection must include standards describing the information that must be submitted before an application for alternate approval will be deemed complete.

(b) A building official who denies an application for alternate approval under this subsection shall provide to the applicant: (A) A written explanation of the basis for the denial; and (B) A statement that describes the applicants appeal rights under subsection (10) of this section. (10)(a) An appeal from a denial under subsection (9) of this section must be made through a municipal administrative process. A municipality shall provide an administrative process that: (A) Is other than a judicial proceeding in a court of law; and (B) Affords the party an opportunity to appeal the denial before an individual, department or body that is other than a plan reviewer, inspector or building official for the municipality. (b) A decision in an administrative process under this subsection must be completed no later than 30 business days after the building official receives notice of the appeal. (c) Notwithstanding ORS 455.690, a municipal administrative process required under this subsection is the exclusive means for appealing a denial under subsection (9) of this section.

Sections 2 and 9 [455.616] of this 2019 Act are added to and made a part of ORS chapter 455. [2019 c.401 1] Sec. 2. (1) As used in this section, small home means a single family residence that is not more than 400 square feet in size. (2) Notwithstanding ORS 455.020 and 455.030, the 2018 International Residential Code, including but not limited to Appendix Q of that code, is adopted as a Small Home Specialty Code applicable to the construction of a small home. (3) Notwithstanding ORS 455.035 and 455.110, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall amend the Low-Rise Residential Dwelling Code as necessary to ensure that for a small home the technical provisions of the Small Home Specialty Code adopted under this section supersede any conflicting technical provisions of the Low-Rise Residential Dwelling Code. (4) Notwithstanding ORS 455.020 and 455.030, and subject to section 9 of this 2019 Act [455.616], the director may not adopt rules amending the Small Home Specialty Code. The director may report recommendations for amendment of the Small Home Specialty Code to an interim or regular committee of the Legislative Assembly related to business, in the manner provided under ORS 192.245. (5) A small home must be constructed with at least one listed photoelectric smoke alarm. The alarm must be installed and located in accordance with the listing requirements specified by the manufacturer, as determined by the Department of Consumer and Business Services or the State Fire Marshal. (6) Each small home shall be considered a single compartment for purposes of residential fire sprinkler design. The design calculation for a small home sprinkler system shall consider a maximum of two fire sprinklers. The fire sprinklers shall have a maximum combined design flow that is less than 20 gallons per minute and be served by a water meter of the standard default size for the area where the home is being sited. The residential fire sprinklers in a small home shall, for coverage purposes, be located according to the location requirements of the installation standard referenced in the 2018 International Residential Code. (7) A municipal building official may allow increased detection and occupant notification, including the installation of heat detector unit alarms, in lieu of a fire sprinkler head for coverage purposes or in lieu of a fire sprinkler system. A building official may allow a replacement under this subsection without establishing that the increased detection and occupant notification is equivalent to a replaced sprinkler head or sprinkler system. (8) A building official may alter, modify or waive any specialty code requirement for a small home when strict adherence to the Small Home Specialty Code is impractical or infeasible. (9) The building permits and zoning permits for a small home shall designate the small home as a single family project. The certificate of occupancy for a small home may allow occupancy of the home only for residential use as a single family dwelling.

As used in this subsection, public body has the meaning given that term in ORS 174.109. (5) The maximum penalty established by this section for a violation may be imposed only upon a finding that the person has engaged in a pattern of violations. The department, by rule, shall define what constitutes a pattern of violations.
