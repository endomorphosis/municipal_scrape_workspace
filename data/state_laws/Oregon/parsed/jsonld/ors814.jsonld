      "text": "Appropriate responses to traffic control devices. This section establishes appropriate pedestrian responses to specific traffic control devices for purposes of ORS 814.020. Authority to place traffic control devices is established under ORS 810.210. Except when acting under the direction of a police officer, a pedestrian is in violation of ORS 814.020 if the pedestrian makes a response to a traffic control device that is not permitted under the following: (1) A pedestrian facing a traffic control device with a green light may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk unless prohibited from doing so by other traffic control devices. (2) A pedestrian facing a traffic control device with a green arrow signal light may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk unless prohibited from doing so by other traffic control devices. (3) A pedestrian facing a traffic control device with a steady yellow light shall not enter the roadway unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal. (4) A pedestrian facing a traffic control device with a steady red light shall not enter the roadway unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal. (5) If a traffic control device is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section are applicable. (6) When a pedestrian control signal showing the words Walk and Wait or Dont Walk or any other pedestrian symbol approved by the Oregon Transportation Commission under ORS 810.200 and 810.210 for the purpose of controlling pedestrian crossing is in place, the signal indicates and applies as follows: (a) If a pedestrian is facing a Walk signal or other symbol approved under ORS 810.200 and 810.210 indicating that the pedestrian may proceed, the pedestrian may proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal. (b) A pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the direction of a signal showing a Wait or Dont Walk or any other symbol approved under ORS 810.200 and 810.210 indicating that the pedestrian may not proceed. A pedestrian who has started crossing a roadway on a signal showing Walk or any other approved symbol to proceed shall proceed with dispatch to a sidewalk or safety island while a signal is showing Wait or Dont Walk or any other approved symbol indicating not to proceed.",
