The watermaster shall keep a true and just account of the time spent in the discharge of the watermasters duties as defined in this section, and the Water Resources Commission shall present a bill of one-half the expense so incurred to the reservoir owner, manager or lessee. If the owner, manager or lessee neglects for 30 days, after presentation of the bill of costs, to pay it, the costs shall be made a charge upon the reservoir and the state shall have a preference lien therefor. Upon notice from the commission, the Attorney General shall foreclose the lien and collect the amount due, as provided in this section, in the same manner as other liens on real property are foreclosed.",

(1)(a) Except when the application is made under ORS 541.327 or when an application for a temporary transfer is made under ORS 540.523, if the holder of a water use subject to transfer for irrigation, domestic use, manufacturing purposes, or other use, for any reason desires to change the place of use, the point of diversion, or the use made of the water, an application to make such change, as the case may be, shall be filed with the Water Resources Department. (b) A holder of a water right certificate that authorizes the storage of water may change the type of use identified in the water right certificate, as described in this section. (2) The application required under subsection (1) of this section shall include: (a) The name of the owner; (b) The previous use of the water; (c) A description of the premises upon which the water is used; (d) A description of the premises upon which it is proposed to use the water; (e) The use that is proposed to be made of the water; (f) The reasons for making the proposed change; and (g) Evidence that the water has been used over the past five years according to the terms and conditions of the owners water right certificate or that the water right is not subject to forfeiture under ORS 540.610. (3) If the application required under subsection (1) of this section is necessary to allow a change in a water right pursuant to ORS 537.348, is necessary to complete a project funded under ORS 541.932, or is approved by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife as a change that will result in a net benefit to fish and wildlife habitat, the department, at the discretion of the Water Resources Director, may waive or assist the applicant in satisfying the requirements of subsection (2)(c) and (d) of this section. The assistance provided by the department may include, but need not be limited to, development of an application map. (4) If the application is to change the point of diversion, the transfer shall include a condition that the holder of the water right provide a proper fish screen at the new point of diversion, if requested by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife. (5) Upon the filing of the application the department shall give notice by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the area in which the water rights are located, for a period of at least two weeks and not less than one publication each week. The notice shall include the date on which the last notice by publication will occur. The cost of the publication shall be paid by the applicant in advance to the department. In applications for only a change in place of use or for a change in the point of diversion of less than one-fourth mile, and where there are no intervening diversions between the old diversion of the applicant and the proposed new diversion, no newspaper notice need be published. The department shall include notice of such applications in the weekly notice published by the department. (6) Within 30 days after the last publication of a newspaper notice of the proposed transfer or the mailing of the departments weekly notice, whichever is later, any person may file, jointly or severally, with the department, a protest against approval of the application. (7) If a timely protest is filed, or in the opinion of the Water Resources Director a hearing is necessary to determine whether the proposed changes as described by the application would result in injury to existing water rights, the department shall hold a hearing on the matter. Notice and conduct of the hearing shall be under the provisions of ORS chapter 183, pertaining to contested cases, and shall be held in the area where the rights are located unless all parties and persons who filed a protest under this subsection stipulate otherwise. (8) An application for a change of use under this section is not required if the beneficial use authorized by the water use subject to transfer is irrigation and the owner of the water right uses the water for incidental agricultural, stock watering and other uses related to irrigation use, so long as there is no increase in the rate, duty, total acreage benefited or season of use. (9) A water right transfer under subsection (1) of this section is not required for a general industrial use that was not included in a water right certificate issued for a specific industrial use if: (a) The quantity of water used for the general industrial use is not greater than the rate allowed in the original water right and not greater than the quantity of water diverted to satisfy the authorized specific use under the original water right; (b) The location where the water is to be used for general industrial use was owned by the holder of the original water right at the time the water right permit was issued; and (c) The person who makes the change in water use provides the following information to the Water Resources Department: (A) The name and mailing address of the person using water under the water right; (B) The water right certificate number; (C) A description of the location of the industrial facility owned by the holder of the original water right at the time the water right permit was issued; and (D) A description of the general industrial use to be made of the water after the change.",

(1)(a) If, after hearing or examination, the Water Resources Commission finds that a proposed change can be effected without injury to existing water rights, the commission shall make an order approving the transfer and fixing a time limit within which the approved changes may be completed. (b) If, after hearing or examination, the commission finds that a proposed change in point of diversion cannot be effected without injury to existing water rights, upon receipt by the commission of an affidavit consenting to the change from every holder of an affected water right, the commission may make an order approving the transfer and fixing a time limit within which the approved changes may be completed. (c) If, after hearing or examination, the commission finds that a proposed change in point of diversion cannot be effected without injury to an in-stream water right granted pursuant to a request under ORS 537.336 or an in-stream water right created pursuant to ORS 537.346 (1), the Water Resources Department may consent to the change only upon a recommendation that the department do so from the agency that requested the in-stream water right. The agency that requested the in-stream water right may recommend that the department consent to the change only if the change will result in a net benefit to the resource consistent with the purposes of the in-stream water right. (d)(A) If an in-stream water right would be injured by a proposed change under paragraph (c) of this subsection, the department shall obtain a recommendation from the agency that requested the in-stream water right. If the recommendation of the agency is to consent to the change, the department shall provide public notice of the recommendation and, consistent with state laws regarding cooperation with Indian tribes in the development and implementation of state agency programs that affect tribes or rights and privileges of tribes, the department shall consult with affected Indian tribes. (B) The recommendation of an agency under this paragraph must be in writing and, if the recommendation is to consent to the change, must describe the extent of the injury to the in-stream water right, the effect on the resource and the net benefit that will occur as a result of the proposed change. The recommendation may include any proposed conditions that are necessary to ensure that the proposed change will be consistent with the recommendation. (C) In determining whether a net benefit will result from the proposed change, the recommendation of an agency must include an analysis of the cumulative impact of any previous changes under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection that allow injury to the affected in-stream water right. (D) A person may comment on the recommendation of an agency. The comment must be in writing and must be received by the department within 30 days after publication of notice under this paragraph. If a written comment received by the department requests a meeting on the proposed change, the department and the agency that requested the in-stream water right shall hold a joint public meeting within 90 days of the receipt of the comment requesting a meeting. (e)(A) If, after review of public comments and consultation with the agency that requested the in-stream water right, the agency that requested the in-stream water right does not withdraw its recommendation to consent to the change, the department may approve the change consistent with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection. (B) An order approving a change under paragraph (c) of this subsection shall include written findings on the extent of the injury to the in-stream water right, the effect on the resource and the net benefit that will occur as a result of the change. The order shall include any conditions necessary to ensure that the change will be consistent with the findings and ensure that the change will result in a continued net benefit to the resource consistent with the purposes of the in-stream water right. (C) In determining whether a net benefit will result from the change, the order of the department must include an analysis of the cumulative impact of any previous changes approved under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection that allow injury to the affected in-stream water right. (f) The time allowed by the commission for completion of an authorized change under paragraphs (a) to (e) of this subsection may not be used when computing a five-year period of nonuse under the provisions of ORS 540.610 (1). (2)(a) If a certificate covering the water right has been previously issued, the commission shall cancel the previous certificate or, if for an irrigation district, the commission may modify the previous certificate and, when proper proof of completion of the authorized changes has been filed with the commission, issue a new certificate or, if for an irrigation district, modify the previous certificate, preserving the previously established priority of rights and covering the authorized changes. If only a portion of the water right covered by the previous certificate is affected by the changes, a separate new certificate may be issued to cover the unaffected portion of the water right. (b) If the change authorized under subsection (1) of this section is necessary to allow a change in a water right pursuant to ORS 537.348, is necessary to complete a project funded under ORS 541.932, or is approved by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife as a change that will result in a net benefit to fish and wildlife habitat, the Water Resources Department, at the discretion of the Water Resources Director, may waive or assist the applicant in satisfying any of the proof of completion requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection. The assistance provided by the department may include, but need not be limited to, development of a final proof survey map and claim of beneficial use. (3) Upon receiving notification of the merger or consolidation of municipal water supply entities, or the formation of a water authority under ORS chapter 450, the commission shall cancel the previous certificates of the entities replaced by the merger, consolidation or formation and issue a new certificate to the newly formed municipality or water authority. The new certificate shall preserve the previously established priority of rights of the replaced entities and shall allow beneficial use of the water on any lands acquired in the merger, consolidation or formation.",

(1) Notwithstanding ORS 537.515 and 537.535, an owner of a surface water use subject to transfer may apply for a transfer of the point of diversion to allow the appropriation of ground water if the proposed transfer complies with the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) of this section and with the requirements for a transfer in point of diversion specified in ORS 540.520 and 540.530. (2) The Water Resources Department may allow a transfer of the point of diversion under subsection (1) of this section if: (a)(A) The new point of diversion appropriates ground water from an aquifer that is hydraulically connected to the authorized surface water source; (B) The proposed change in point of diversion will not result in enlargement of the original water right or in injury to other water right holders; (C) The use of the new point of diversion will affect the surface water source similarly to the authorized point of diversion specified in the water use subject to transfer; and (D) The withdrawal of ground water at the new point of diversion is located within 500 feet of the surface water source and, when the surface water source is a stream, is also located within 1,000 feet upstream or downstream of the original point of diversion as specified in the water use subject to transfer; or (b) The new point of diversion is not located within the distance requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(D) of this subsection, the holder of the water use subject to transfer submits to the department evidence prepared by a licensed geologist that demonstrates that the use of the ground water at the new point of diversion will meet the criteria set forth in paragraph (a)(A) to (C) of this subsection. (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, the department shall allow a transfer of the point of diversion under subsection (1) of this section in the Deschutes Basin ground water study area if: (a) The new point of diversion appropriates ground water from an aquifer that is hydraulically connected to the authorized surface water source; (b) The proposed change in the point of diversion will not result in enlargement of the original water right or in injury to other water right holders; and (c) The use of the new point of diversion will affect the surface water source hydraulically connected to the authorized point of diversion specified in the water use subject to transfer. The department may not require that the use of the new point of diversion affect the surface water source similarly to the authorized point of diversion specified in the water use subject to transfer under this subsection. (4) All applicable restrictions that existed at the original point of diversion shall apply at the new point of diversion allowed under this section. (5) The new point of diversion shall retain the original date of priority. However, if within five years after approving the transfer, the department finds that the transfer results in substantial interference with existing ground water rights that would not have occurred in the absence of the transfer, the new point of diversion shall be subordinate to any existing right injured by the transferred water right or permit. (6)(a) The department shall approve an application to return to the last authorized surface water point of diversion if a holder of a water use subject to transfer submits an application to the department within five years after the department approves a transfer under this section. (b) The department shall approve an application to return to the last authorized surface water point of diversion after five years of the date the department allows a transfer under subsection (3) of this section if a holder of a water use subject to transfer submits an application to the department, and the return will not result in injury to an existing water right. (7) For transfers allowed under this section, the department shall require mitigation measures to prevent depletion from any surface water source not specified in the permit or certificated or decreed water right, except that the department may not require mitigation measures if the transfer complies with subsection (3) of this section. (8) The Water Resources Commission shall adopt rules that prescribe: (a) The process for reviewing applications submitted under this section; (b) The persons to whom the department shall provide notice of the receipt of an application submitted under this section; and (c) The persons who may participate in the process of reviewing applications submitted under this section. (9) As used in this section: (a) Deschutes Basin ground water study area means the part of the Deschutes River Basin that is designated by the Water Resources Commission by rule. (b) Similarly means that the use of ground water at the new point of diversion affects the surface water source specified in the permit or certificated or decreed water right and would result in stream depletion of at least 50 percent of the rate of appropriation within 10 days of continuous pumping.",

(1) Provided that the proposed transfer complies with all of the provisions of this subsection and will not result in injury to any existing water right, a district with a manager may, for one irrigation season, temporarily transfer the place of use of water appurtenant to any land within the legal boundaries of the district to an equal acreage elsewhere within the legal boundaries of that district or temporarily transfer the type of use identified in a right to store water. A temporary transfer of the place of use may occur if: (a) The rate and duty, and the total number of acres to which water will be applied under the transfer, do not exceed existing limits on the water use subject to transfer; (b) The type of use authorized under the water use subject to transfer remains the same; and (c) The land from which the water use is being transferred does not receive any water under the right being transferred during the irrigation season in which the change is made. (2) Provided that the proposed transfer complies with all the provisions of this subsection and will not result in injury to or enlargement of an existing water right, a district with a manager may, for one irrigation season, temporarily change the point of diversion or appropriation combined with a change in place of use, change the point of diversion in the event that an emergency prevents the district from diverting water from its authorized point of diversion, change the point of diversion to allow for the appropriation of ground water or change a primary right to a supplemental right if: (a) The land on which the water is to be used is within the districts legal boundaries established pursuant to ORS chapter 545, 547, 552, 553 or 554; (b) The other terms of the permit or certificate remain the same, including the beneficial use for which the water is used and the number of acres to which water is applied; (c) The diversion is provided with a proper fish screen, if required by the Water Resources Department; and (d) For a proposal to transfer the point of diversion to allow for the appropriation of ground water, the proposed change meets the standards set forth in ORS 540.531 (2). (3) When a district or an owner or an owners agent within a district who is subject to the charges or assessments of the district wishes to use water on alternate acreage within the district, if the district has approved the owners request, the district shall submit to the department a petition seeking a temporary transfer under this section. The district shall submit the petition prior to making the proposed change. The petition may contain changes to one or more tax lots within the district and shall: (a) Include the information required under ORS 540.574 (3); (b) Be accompanied by a map in a form satisfactory to the department and certified by the district. If the water right is on a tract of land of five acres or less, the assessors tax map with a notation of the acres of water right shall be sufficient for identification of the tract and place of use; (c) Include a statement that a written authorization for the transfer from each landowner affected by the particular temporary transfer is on file with the district; (d) Include any other information required by rules of the Water Resources Commission; and (e) Include a fee in the amount required under ORS 536.050 (1)(i). (4) The district shall notify each affected landowner that the department may reject the transfer or may require mitigation to avoid injury to other water rights. Upon receipt of a completed petition under subsection (3) of this section, the department shall place a summary of the petition in the weekly notice published by the department. The department shall accept written public comments on the petition for 30 days following publication of the weekly notice. The department shall consider comments that pertain to the potential for injury to an existing water right or to the enlargement of the water use subject to transfer in determining whether to condition, reject or revoke a temporary transfer. (5) Use of water on lands from which the right is transferred and in the new temporary location during the same irrigation season or calendar year is prohibited and may subject the district and the landowner to civil penalties. (6) The department may condition, reject or revoke a temporary transfer at any time to the extent necessary to avoid injury if the department finds the transfer is causing injury to an existing water right. (7) Upon expiration of the temporary transfer period, all uses of water for which a temporary transfer is allowed under this section shall revert automatically to the terms and conditions of the original water right permit, certificate or adjudication under ORS chapter 539 as evidenced by a court decree. (8) The time during which water is used under an approved temporary transfer order does not apply toward a finding of forfeiture under ORS 540.610.

If the applicant does not include the supplemental water right or permit in the transfer application, the Water Resources Department shall notify the applicant that the supplemental water right or permit will be canceled before the department issues the order approving the transfer of the primary water right, unless within 30 days the applicant modifies the application to include the supplemental water right or permit or withdraws the application. The department may approve the transfer of the supplemental water right or permit in accordance with the provisions of ORS 540.520 and 540.530. The department shall not approve the transfer of a supplemental water right or permit if the transfer would result in enlargement of the original water right or injury to an existing water right. If the department approves the transfer of the primary water right but does not approve the transfer of the supplemental water right or permit, the department shall notify the applicant of the departments intent to cancel that portion of the supplemental water right or permit described in the transfer application before the department issues the primary water right transfer order, unless the applicant withdraws the transfer application within 90 days.

(3)(a) Any water used under a permit or certificate issued to a municipality, or under rights conferred by ORS 538.410 to 538.450, or under the registration system set forth in ORS 537.132, may be applied to beneficial use on lands to which the right is not appurtenant if: (A) The water is applied to lands which are acquired by annexation or through merger, consolidation or formation of a water authority, so long as the rate and use of water allowed in the original certificate is not exceeded; (B) The use continues to be for municipal purposes and would not interfere with or impair prior vested water rights; or (C) The use is authorized under a permit granted under ORS 468B.050 or 468B.053 and for which a reclaimed water registration form has been filed under ORS 537.132.

(4) Pursuant to the provisions of ORS 540.570 or 540.585, any water used under a permit or certificate issued to a district may be applied to beneficial use on lands within the district to which the right is not appurtenant. (5) The relocation of a point of diversion as necessary to follow the movements of a naturally changing stream channel does not constitute a change in point of diversion for purposes of ORS 540.520 if: (a) The diversion point stays within 500 feet of the point of diversion on record with the Water Resources Department; (b) The change does not move the diversion point upstream or downstream beyond the diversion point of another appropriator; and (c) The diversion is provided with a proper fish screen, if requested by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife. (6) In the event that government action results in or creates a reasonable expectation of a change in the surface level of a surface water source that impairs or threatens to impair access to a point of diversion authorized by a water right permit, certificate or decree, the owner of the water right may change the point of diversion or add an additional point of diversion in accordance with the provisions of this section in lieu of complying with the requirements of ORS 540.520 and 540.530. Before changing the point of diversion, the water right owner shall provide written notice of the proposed change to the Water Resources Department. Within 15 days after receipt of such notice, the department shall provide notice by publication in the departments public notice of water right applications. Within 60 days after the department receives notice from the owner, the Water Resources Director, by order, shall approve the change unless the director finds the changes will result in injury to other existing water rights. All other terms and conditions of the water right shall remain in effect.

      "text": "Use as measure of water right; forfeiture for nonuse; confirmation of rights of municipalities. (1) Beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure and the limit of all rights to the use of water in this state. Whenever the holder of a perfected and developed water right ceases or fails to use all or part of the water appropriated for a period of five successive years, or for a period of five years that is calculated in whole or in part as described in subsection (4) of this section, the failure to use shall establish a rebuttable presumption of forfeiture of all or part of the water right. (2) Upon a showing of failure to use beneficially for five successive years, or for a period of five years that is calculated in whole or in part as described in subsection (4) of this section, the appropriator has the burden of rebutting the presumption of forfeiture by showing one or more of the following: (a) The water right is for use of water, or rights of use, acquired by cities and towns in this state, by appropriation or by purchase, for all reasonable and usual municipal purposes. (b) A finding of forfeiture would impair the rights of such cities and towns to the use of water, whether acquired by appropriation or purchase, or heretofore recognized by act of the legislature, or which may hereafter be acquired. (c) The use of water, or rights of use, are appurtenant to property obtained by the Department of Veterans Affairs under ORS 407.135 or 407.145 for three years after the expiration of the period of redemption provided for in ORS 18.964 while the land is held by the Department of Veterans Affairs, even if during such time the water is not used for a period of more than five successive years. (d) The use of water, or rights of use, under a water right, if the owner of the property to which the right is appurtenant is unable to use the water due to economic hardship as defined by rule by the Water Resources Commission. (e) The period of nonuse occurred during a period of time within which land was withdrawn from use in accordance with the Federal Conservation Reserve Program, Act of Congress of December 23, 1985, chapter 198 (16 U.S.C. 3831-3836, 3841-3845). If necessary, in a cancellation proceeding under this section, the water right holder rebutting the presumption under this paragraph shall provide documentation that the water right holders land was withdrawn from use under a federal reserve program. (f) The end of the alleged period of nonuse occurred more than 15 years before the date upon which evidence of nonuse was submitted to the commission or the commission initiated cancellation proceedings under ORS 540.631, whichever occurs first. (g) The owner of the property to which the water right was appurtenant is unable to use the water because the use of water under the right is discontinued under an order of the commission under ORS 537.775. (h) The nonuse occurred during a period of time within which the water right holder was using reclaimed water in lieu of using water under an existing water right. (i) The nonuse occurred during a period of time within which the water right holder was reusing water through land application as authorized by ORS 537.141 (1)(i) or 537.545 (1)(g) in lieu of using water under an existing water right. (j) The owner or occupant of the property to which the water right is appurtenant was unable to make full beneficial use of the water because water was not available. A water right holder rebutting the presumption under this paragraph shall provide evidence that the water right holder was ready, willing and able to use the water had it been available. (k) The holder of a water right is prohibited by law from using the water. If the prohibition is subject to remedial action that would allow the use of the water, the water right holder shall provide evidence that the water right holder is conducting the remedial action with reasonable diligence. (L) The nonuse occurred during a period of time within which the exercise of all or part of the water right was not necessary due to climatic conditions, so long as the water right holder had a facility capable of handling the full allowed rate and duty, and was otherwise ready, willing and able to use the entire amount of water allowed under the water right. (m) The nonuse occurred during a period of time within which the water was included in a transfer application pending before the Water Resources Department. (n) The nonuse of a supplemental water right occurred during a period of time when the primary water right used in conjunction with that supplemental water right was leased as an in-stream water right pursuant to ORS 537.348. (3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, if the holder of a perfected and developed water right uses less water to accomplish the beneficial use allowed by the right, the right is not subject to forfeiture so long as: (a) The holder has a facility capable of handling the entire rate and duty authorized under the right; and (b) The holder is otherwise ready, willing and able to make full use of the right. (4)(a) As used in this subsection, drought year means a calendar year in which the Governor declares, pursuant to ORS 536.740, that a severe, continuing drought exists, or is likely to exist, within a county. (b) A drought year does not count as a year for purposes of forfeiture under this section for a holder of a perfected and developed water right within the county for which the drought year was declared, if the holder has a facility capable of handling the entire rate and duty authorized under the water right and is otherwise ready, willing and able to make full use of the water right. (c) A year, during which nonuse occurs, that precedes or follows a drought year counts as a year for purposes of forfeiture under this section for a holder of a perfected and developed water right within the county for which the drought year was declared. (d) This subsection may not have any effect on consideration of an application under ORS 540.520. (5) The right of all cities and towns in this state to acquire rights to the use of the water of natural streams and lakes, not otherwise appropriated, and subject to existing rights, for all reasonable and usual municipal purposes, and for such future reasonable and usual municipal purposes as may reasonably be anticipated by reason of growth of population, or to secure sufficient water supply in cases of emergency, is expressly confirmed. (6) After a water right is forfeited under subsection (1) of this section, the water that was the subject of use shall revert to the public and become again the subject of appropriation in the manner provided by law, subject to existing priorities.",
