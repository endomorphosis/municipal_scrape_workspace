The Legislative Assembly finds that: (1) Uncoordinated use of lands within this state threatens the orderly development, the environment of this state and the health, safety, order, convenience, prosperity and welfare of the people of this state. (2) To promote coordinated administration of land uses consistent with comprehensive plans adopted throughout the state, it is necessary to establish a process for the review of state agency, city, county and special district land conservation and development plans for compliance with goals. (3) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4) of this section, cities and counties should remain as the agencies to consider, promote and manage the local aspects of land conservation and development for the best interests of the people within their jurisdictions. (4) The promotion of coordinated statewide land conservation and development requires the creation of a statewide planning agency to prescribe planning goals and objectives to be applied by state agencies, cities, counties and special districts throughout the state. (5) City and county governments are responsible for the development of local comprehensive plans. The purpose of ORS 195.065, 195.070 and 195.075 is to enhance coordination among cities, counties and special districts to assure effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery of urban services required under those local comprehensive plans.",

These comprehensive plans: (a) Must be adopted by the appropriate governing body at the local and state levels; (b) Are expressions of public policy in the form of policy statements, generalized maps and standards and guidelines; (c) Shall be the basis for more specific rules and land use regulations which implement the policies expressed through the comprehensive plans; (d) Shall be prepared to assure that all public actions are consistent and coordinated with the policies expressed through the comprehensive plans; and (e) Shall be regularly reviewed and, if necessary, amended to keep them consistent with the changing needs and desires of the public they are designed to serve. (2)(a) The overarching principles guiding the land use program in the State of Oregon are to: (A) Provide a healthy environment; (B) Sustain a prosperous economy; (C) Ensure a desirable quality of life; and (D) Equitably allocate the benefits and burdens of land use planning. (b) Additionally, the land use program should, but is not required to, help communities achieve sustainable development patterns and manage the effects of climate change. (c) The overarching principles in paragraph (a) of this subsection and the purposes in paragraph (b) of this subsection provide guidance to: (A) The Legislative Assembly when enacting a law regulating land use. (B) A public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, when the public body: (i) Adopts or interprets goals, comprehensive plans and land use regulations implementing the plans, or administrative rules implementing a provision of ORS chapter 195, 196, 197, 197A, 215 or 227; or (ii) Interprets a law governing land use. (d) Use of the overarching principles in paragraph (a) of this subsection and the purposes in paragraph (b) of this subsection is not a legal requirement for the Legislative Assembly or other public body and is not judicially enforceable. (3) The equitable balance between state and local government interests can best be achieved by resolution of conflicts using alternative dispute resolution techniques such as mediation, collaborative planning and arbitration. Such dispute resolution techniques are particularly suitable for conflicts arising over periodic review, comprehensive plan and land use regulations, amendments, enforcement issues and local interpretation of state land use policy.",

See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation. Note: Sections 1, 2 and 5, chapter 217, Oregon Laws 2021, provide: Sec. 1. Section 2 of this 2021 Act is added to and made a part of ORS chapter 197 [series became ORS chapters 197 and 197A]. [2021 c.217 1] Sec. 2. Restoration of uses destroyed by 2020 wildfires. (1) This section applies only to owners of properties on which structures or uses were destroyed or interrupted by a wildfire that was identified in an executive order issued by the Governor in accordance with the Emergency Conflagration Act under ORS 476.510 to 476.610 between August 1 and September 30, 2020. The local government may alter, restore or replace such a use as provided in this section in lieu of another process. (2) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, a property owner may alter, restore or replace a nonresidential use without further application with the local government if: (a) The use was allowed outright as an accessory use, without regard to whether the primary use was destroyed or was or will be restored; (b)(A) The use was subject to a land use process; and (B) A permit, including a conditional permit, was issued for the use notwithstanding any expiration of the permit or any subsequent changes to the law or process; or (c)(A) The use was established before a requirement that the use be subject to a land use process; and (B) The replacement use conforms as nearly as practicable to records of the use with the county assessor, building permit information or other reliable records. (3) The local government shall approve an application to alter, restore or replace a dwelling if the local government determines that the evidence in the record establishes that: (a) The former dwelling: (A) Had intact exterior walls and roof structure; (B) Had indoor plumbing consisting of a kitchen sink, toilet and bathing facilities connected to a sanitary waste disposal system; (C) Had interior wiring for interior lights; (D) Had a heating system; and (E)(i) Was authorized by building permits or other regulatory approval process by the appropriate authority; or (ii) Was assessed as a residential dwelling for purposes of ad valorem taxation for the tax year beginning July 1, 2001, and is not subject to unresolved enforcement proceedings questioning the lawfulness of the dwelling; and (b) The proposed dwelling will: (A) Not exceed the floor area of the destroyed dwelling by more than 10 percent; (B) Be adequately served by water, sanitation and roads; (C) Be located wholly or partially within the footprint of the destroyed dwelling unless the applicant chooses a different location within the same lot or parcel to comply with local flood regulations or to avoid a natural hazard area; and (D) Comply with applicable building codes that were in effect on the later of: (i) January 1, 2008; or (ii) The date of the former dwellings construction. (4) A local government may not add conditions to the approval or siting of a dwelling under subsection (3) of this section except as necessary to maintain participation in the National Flood Insurance Program under 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq. A local government may require that the property owner submit an application for a permit for the approval or siting of a nonresidential use only for the purpose of establishing such conditions that are necessary to maintain participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. (5) A local government may delegate the approval of an application under subsection (3) of this section to: (a) A hearings officer, as defined in ORS 215.402 or 227.160; (b) A planning commission, as described in ORS 215.020; or (c) A building official, as defined in ORS 455.715. (6) The findings of the local government or its designee in approving an application under subsection (3) of this section is not a land use decision. The local government may not require an applicant give notice to any nonparty. The findings and conclusions of the local government are entitled to deference if there is any evidence to support the findings and are subject to review only under ORS 34.010 to 34.100. (7) If a local government determines based on the evidence in the record that the use legally existed, the local government may, through a land use decision, approve an application to alter, restore or replace a use for which a land use application, building permit or other regulatory approval was required but record of the approval is unavailable for: (a) A dwelling built after January 1, 2001, that complies with subsection (3)(a)(A) to (D) and (b) of this section; or (b) A nonresidential use or structure. (8) An application under this section must be filed on or before September 30, 2025. (9) For applications described in subsection (3) of this section, the amount of time during which an applicant is permitted to occupy a recreational vehicle under ORS 197.493 (1)(b)(C) is extended to December 30, 2030. (10) An approval of an application under this section expires only if the property owner has not commenced development of the structure or use on or before December 30, 2030. [2021 c.217 2; 2021 c.520 3; 2023 c.327 2] Sec. 5. Sections 2 and 4 of this 2021 Act are repealed on January 2, 2031. [2021 c.217 5] LAND CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION",

(1) Upon the request of a local government, the Land Conservation and Development Commission shall by order grant, deny or continue acknowledgment of compliance of comprehensive plan and land use regulations with the goals. A commission order granting, denying or continuing acknowledgment shall be entered within 90 days of the date of the request by the local government unless the commission finds that due to extenuating circumstances a period of time greater than 90 days is required. (2) In accordance with rules of the commission, the Director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development shall prepare a report for the commission stating whether the comprehensive plan and land use regulations for which acknowledgment is sought are in compliance with the goals. The rules of the commission shall: (a) Provide a reasonable opportunity for persons to prepare and to submit to the director written comments and objections to the acknowledgment request; and (b) Authorize the director to investigate and in the report to resolve issues raised in the comments and objections or by the directors own review of the comprehensive plan and land use regulations. (3) Upon completion of the report and before the commission meeting at which the directors report is to be considered, the director shall afford the local government and persons who submitted written comments or objections a reasonable opportunity to file written exceptions to the report. (4) The commissions review of the acknowledgment request shall be confined to the record of proceedings before the local government, any comments, objections and exceptions filed under subsections (2) and (3) of this section and the report of the director. Upon its consideration of an acknowledgment request, the commission may entertain oral argument from the director and from persons who filed written comments, objections or exceptions. However, the commission shall not allow additional evidence or testimony that could have been presented to the local government or to the director but was not. (5) A commission order granting, denying or continuing acknowledgment shall include a clear statement of findings which sets forth the basis for the approval, denial or continuance of acknowledgment. The findings shall: (a) Identify the goals applicable to the comprehensive plan and land use regulations; and (b) Include a clear statement of findings in support of the determinations of compliance and noncompliance. (6) A commission order granting acknowledgment shall be limited to an identifiable geographic area described in the order if: (a) Only the identified geographic area is the subject of the acknowledgment request; or (b) Specific geographic areas do not comply with the applicable goals, and the goal requirements are not technical or minor in nature. (7) The commission may issue a limited acknowledgment order when a previously issued acknowledgment order is reversed or remanded by the Court of Appeals or the Oregon Supreme Court. Such a limited acknowledgment order may deny or continue acknowledgment of that part of the comprehensive plan or land use regulations that the court found not in compliance or not consistent with the goals and grant acknowledgment of all other parts of the comprehensive plan and land use regulations. (8) A limited acknowledgment order shall be considered an acknowledgment for all purposes and shall be a final order for purposes of judicial review with respect to the acknowledged geographic area. A limited order may be adopted in conjunction with a continuance or denial order. (9) The director shall notify the Real Estate Agency, the local government and all persons who filed comments or objections with the director of any grant, denial or continuance of acknowledgment. (10) The commission may grant a planning extension, which shall be a grant of additional time for a local government to comply with the goals in accordance with a compliance schedule. A compliance schedule shall be a listing of the tasks which the local government must complete in order to bring its comprehensive plan, land use regulations, land use decisions and limited land use decisions into initial compliance with the goals, including a generalized time schedule showing when the tasks are estimated to be completed and when a comprehensive plan or land use regulations which comply with the goals are estimated to be adopted. In developing a compliance schedule, the commission shall consider the population, geographic area, resources and capabilities of the city or county. (11) As used in this section: (a) Continuance means a commission order that: (A) Certifies that all or part of a comprehensive plan, land use regulations or both a comprehensive plan and land use regulations do not comply with one or more goals; (B) Specifies amendments or other action that must be completed within a specified time period for acknowledgment to occur; and (C) Is a final order for purposes of judicial review of the comprehensive plan, land use regulations or both the comprehensive plan and land use regulations as to the parts found consistent or in compliance with the goals. (b) Denial means a commission order that: (A) Certifies that a comprehensive plan, land use regulations or both a comprehensive plan and land use regulations do not comply with one or more goals; (B) Specifies amendments or other action that must be completed for acknowledgment to occur; and (C) Is used when the amendments or other changes required in the comprehensive plan, land use regulations or both the comprehensive plan and land use regulations affect many goals and are likely to take a substantial period of time to complete.",

(8) The board shall reverse or remand a decision involving the application of a plan or land use regulation provision if the decision is not in compliance with applicable provisions of the comprehensive plan or land use regulations. (9) In addition to the review under subsections (1) to (8) of this section, the board shall reverse or remand the land use decision under review if the board finds: (a) The local government or special district: (A) Exceeded its jurisdiction; (B) Failed to follow the procedures applicable to the matter before it in a manner that prejudiced the substantial rights of the petitioner; (C) Made a decision not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record; (D) Improperly construed the applicable law; or (E) Made an unconstitutional decision; or (b) The state agency made a decision that violated the goals. (10)(a) The board shall reverse a local government decision and order the local government to grant approval of an application for development denied by the local government if the board finds: (A) Based on the evidence in the record, that the local government decision is outside the range of discretion allowed the local government under its comprehensive plan and implementing ordinances; or (B) That the local governments action was for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of ORS 215.427 or 227.178. (b) If the board does reverse the decision and orders the local government to grant approval of the application, the board shall award attorney fees to the applicant and against the local government.

(b) Whenever the findings are defective because of failure to recite adequate facts or legal conclusions or failure to adequately identify the standards or their relation to the facts, but the parties identify relevant evidence in the record which clearly supports the decision or a part of the decision, the board shall affirm the decision or the part of the decision supported by the record and remand the remainder to the local government, with direction indicating appropriate remedial action. (12) The board may reverse or remand a land use decision under review due to ex parte contacts or bias resulting from ex parte contacts with a member of the decision-making body, only if the member of the decision-making body did not comply with ORS 215.422 (3) or 227.180 (3), whichever is applicable. (13) Subsection (12) of this section does not apply to reverse or remand of a land use decision due to ex parte contact or bias resulting from ex parte contact with a hearings officer. (14) The board shall reverse or remand a land use decision or limited land use decision which violates a commission order issued under ORS 197.328. (15) In cases in which a local government provides a quasi-judicial land use hearing on a limited land use decision, the requirements of subsections (12) and (13) of this section apply.

      "text": "(1) An order issued under ORS 197.328 and the copy of the order mailed to the local government, state agency or special district must set forth: (a) The nature of the noncompliance, including, but not limited to, the contents of the comprehensive plan or land use regulation, if any, of a local government that do not comply with the goals or the contents of a plan, program or regulation affecting land use adopted by a state agency or special district that do not comply with the goals. In the case of a pattern or practice of decision-making, the order must specify the decision-making that constitutes the pattern or practice, including specific provisions the Land Conservation and Development Commission believes are being misapplied. (b) The specific lands, if any, within a local government for which the existing plan or land use regulation, if any, does not comply with the goals. (c) The corrective action decided upon by the commission, including the specific requirements, with which the local government, state agency or special district must comply. In the case of a pattern or practice of decision-making, the commission may require revisions to the comprehensive plan, land use regulations or local procedures which the commission believes are necessary to correct the pattern or practice. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, except as provided in subsection (3)(c) of this section, an enforcement order does not affect: (A) Land use applications filed with a local government prior to the date of adoption of the enforcement order unless specifically identified by the order; (B) Land use approvals issued by a local government prior to the date of adoption of the enforcement order; or (C) The time limit for exercising land use approvals issued by a local government prior to the date of adoption of the enforcement order. (2) Judicial review of a final order of the commission is governed by the provisions of ORS chapter 183 applicable to contested cases except as otherwise stated in this section. The commissions final order must include a clear statement of findings which set forth the basis for the order. Where a petition to review the order has been filed in the Court of Appeals, the commission shall transmit to the court the entire administrative record of the proceeding under review. Notwithstanding ORS 183.482 (3) relating to a stay of enforcement of an agency order, an appellate court, before it may stay an order of the commission, shall give due consideration to the public interest in the continued enforcement of the commissions order and may consider testimony or affidavits thereon. Upon review, an appellate court may affirm, reverse, modify or remand the order. The court shall reverse, modify or remand the order only if it finds: (a) The order to be unlawful in substance or procedure, but an error in procedure is not cause for reversal, modification or remand unless the court finds that substantial rights of any party were prejudiced thereby; (b) The order to be unconstitutional; (c) The order is invalid because it exceeds the statutory authority of the agency; or (d) The order is not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record. (3)(a) If the commission finds that in the interim period during which a local government, state agency or special district would be bringing itself into compliance with the commissions order under ORS 197.320 or subsection (2) of this section it would be contrary to the public interest in the conservation or sound development of land to allow the continuation of some or all categories of land use decisions or limited land use decisions, it shall, as part of its order, limit, prohibit or require the approval by the local government of applications for subdivisions, partitions, building permits, limited land use decisions or land use decisions until the plan, land use regulation or subsequent land use decisions and limited land use decisions are brought into compliance. The commission may issue an order that requires review of local decisions by a hearings officer or the Department of Land Conservation and Development before the local decision becomes final. (b) Any requirement under this subsection may be imposed only if the commission finds that the activity, if continued, aggravates the goal, comprehensive plan or land use regulation violation and that the requirement is necessary to correct the violation. (c) The limitations on enforcement orders under subsection (1)(c)(B) of this section do not affect the commissions authority to limit, prohibit or require application of specified criteria to subsequent land use decisions involving land use approvals issued by a local government prior to the date of adoption of the enforcement order. (4) As part of its order under ORS 197.320 or subsection (2) of this section, the commission may withhold grant funds from the local government to which the order is directed. As part of an order issued under this section, the commission may notify the officer responsible for disbursing state-shared revenues to withhold that portion of state-shared revenues to which the local government is entitled under ORS 221.770, 323.455, 366.762 and 366.800 and ORS chapter 471 which represents the amount of state planning grant moneys previously provided the local government by the commission. The officer responsible for disbursing state-shared revenues shall withhold state-shared revenues as outlined in this section and shall release funds to the local government or department when notified to so do by the commission or its designee. The commission may retain a portion of the withheld revenues to cover costs of providing services incurred under the order, including use of a hearings officer or staff resources to monitor land use decisions and limited land use decisions or conduct hearings. The remainder of the funds withheld under this provision shall be released to the local government upon completion of requirements of the commission order. (5)(a) As part of its order under this section, the commission may notify the officer responsible for disbursing funds from any grant or loan made by a state agency to withhold such funds from a special district to which the order is directed. The officer responsible for disbursing funds shall withhold funds as outlined in this section and shall release funds to the special district or department when notified to do so by the commission. (b) The commission may retain a portion of the funds withheld to cover costs of providing services incurred under the order, including use of a hearings officer or staff resources to monitor land use decisions and limited land use decisions or conduct hearings. The remainder of the funds withheld under this provision shall be released to the special district upon completion of the requirements of the commission order. (6) As part of its order under this section, upon finding a city failed to comply with ORS 197.320 (13), the commission may, consistent with the principles in ORS 197A.130 (1), require the city to: (a) Comply with the housing acceleration agreement under ORS 197A.130 (6). (b) Take specific actions that are part of the citys housing production strategy under ORS 197A.100. (c) Impose appropriate models that have been developed by department, including model ordinances, procedures, actions or anti-displacement measures. (d) Reduce maximum timelines for review of needed housing or specific types of housing or affordability levels, including through ministerial approval or any other expedited existing approval process. (e) Take specific actions to waive or amend local ordinances. (f) Forfeit grant funds under subsection (4) of this section. (7) The commission may institute actions or proceedings for legal or equitable remedies in the Circuit Court for Marion County or in the circuit court for the county to which the commissions order is directed or within which all or a portion of the applicable city is located to enforce compliance with the provisions of any order issued under this section or to restrain violations thereof. Such actions or proceedings may be instituted without the necessity of prior agency notice, hearing and order on an alleged violation.",

The notification list shall be compiled from the most recent property tax assessment roll. For purposes of appeal to the referee under ORS 197.375, this requirement shall be deemed met when the local government can provide an affidavit or other certification that such notice was given. Notice shall also be provided to any neighborhood or community planning organization recognized by the governing body and whose boundaries include the site. (3) The notice required under subsection (2) of this section shall: (a) State: (A) The deadline for submitting written comments; (B) That issues that may provide the basis for an appeal to the referee must be raised in writing prior to the expiration of the comment period; and (C) That issues must be raised with sufficient specificity to enable the local government to respond to the issue. (b) Set forth, by commonly used citation, the applicable criteria for the decision. (c) Set forth the street address or other easily understood geographical reference to the subject property. (d) State the place, date and time that comments are due. (e) State a time and place where copies of all evidence submitted by the applicant will be available for review.

An approval may include conditions to ensure that the application meets the applicable land use regulations. For applications subject to this section, the local government: (A) Shall not hold a hearing on the application; and (B) Shall issue a written determination of compliance or noncompliance with applicable land use regulations that includes a summary statement explaining the determination. The summary statement may be in any form reasonably intended to communicate the local governments basis for the determination.

(2) The local government shall appoint a referee to decide the appeal of a decision made under this section. The referee may not be an employee or official of the local government. However, a local government that has designated a hearings officer under ORS 215.406 or 227.165 may designate the hearings officer as the referee for appeals of a decision made under ORS 197.360 and 197.365. (3) Within seven days of being appointed to decide the appeal, the referee shall notify the applicant, the local government, the appellant if other than the applicant, any person or organization entitled to notice under ORS 197.365 (2) that provided written comments to the local government and all providers of public facilities and services entitled to notice under ORS 197.365 (2) and advise them of the manner in which they may participate in the appeal. A person or organization that provided written comments to the local government but did not file an appeal under subsection (1) of this section may participate only with respect to the issues raised in the written comments submitted by that person or organization. The referee may use any procedure for decision-making consistent with the interests of the parties to ensure a fair opportunity to present information and argument. The referee shall provide the local government an opportunity to explain its decision, but is not limited to reviewing the local government decision and may consider information not presented to the local government. (4)(a) The referee shall apply the substantive requirements of the applicable land use regulations and ORS 92.031 or 197.360. If the referee determines that the application does not qualify as an expedited land division or a middle housing land division, as defined in ORS 92.031, the referee shall remand the application for consideration as a land use decision or limited land use decision. In all other cases, the referee shall seek to identify means by which the application can satisfy the applicable requirements. (b) For an expedited land use division, the referee may not reduce the density of the land division application. (c) The referee shall make a written decision approving or denying the application or approving it with conditions designed to ensure that the application satisfies the land use regulations, within 42 days of the filing of an appeal. The referee may not remand the application to the local government for any reason other than as set forth in this subsection. (5) Unless the governing body of the local government finds exigent circumstances, a referee who fails to issue a written decision within 42 days of the filing of an appeal shall receive no compensation for service as referee in the appeal. (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the referee shall order the local government to refund the deposit for costs to an appellant who materially improves his or her position from the decision of the local government.

(7) The following standards apply to the provisions of subsection (6) of this section: (a) The resort must be located on a site of 20 acres or more. (b) At least $2 million must be spent on improvements for on-site developed recreational facilities and visitor-oriented accommodations exclusive of costs for land, sewer and water facilities and roads.

Such recreational resources include, but are not limited to, a hot spring, a ski slope or a fishing stream. (g) The resort must be constructed and located so that it is not designed to attract highway traffic. Resorts may not use any manner of outdoor advertising signing except: (A) Tourist oriented directional signs as provided in ORS 377.715 to 377.830; and (B) On-site identification and directional signs. (8) Spending required under subsections (3) and (7) of this section is stated in 1993 dollars. The spending required shall be adjusted to the year in which calculations are made in accordance with the United States Consumer Price Index. (9) When making a land use decision authorizing construction of a destination resort in eastern Oregon, as defined in ORS 321.805, the governing body of the county or its designee shall require the resort developer to provide an annual accounting to document compliance with the overnight lodging standards of this section. The annual accounting requirement commences one year after the initial lot or unit sales. The annual accounting must contain: (a) Documentation showing that the resort contains a minimum of 150 permanent units of overnight lodging or, during the phase-in period, documentation showing the resort is not yet required to have constructed 150 units of overnight lodging. (b) Documentation showing that the resort meets the lodging ratio described in subsection (4) of this section.

(2) Such moratoria, particularly when limited in duration and scope, and adopted pursuant to growth management systems that further the statewide planning goals and local comprehensive plans, may be both necessary and desirable. (3) Clear state standards should be established to ensure that: (a) The need for moratoria is considered and documented; (b) The impact on property owners, housing and economic development is minimized; and (c) Necessary and properly enacted moratoria are not subjected to undue litigation.",

(2) For urban or urbanizable land, a moratorium may be justified by demonstration of a need to prevent a shortage of public facilities which would otherwise occur during the effective period of the moratorium. Such a demonstration shall be based upon reasonably available information, and shall include, but need not be limited to, findings: (a) Showing the extent of need beyond the estimated capacity of existing public facilities expected to result from new land development, including identification of any public facilities currently operating beyond capacity, and the portion of such capacity already committed to development; (b) That the moratorium is reasonably limited to those areas of the city, county or special district where a shortage of key public facilities would otherwise occur; and (c) That the housing and economic development needs of the area affected have been accommodated as much as possible in any program for allocating any remaining public facility capacity. (3) A moratorium not based on a shortage of public facilities under subsection (2) of this section may be justified only by a demonstration of compelling need. Such a demonstration shall be based upon reasonably available information and shall include, but need not be limited to, findings: (a) For urban or urbanizable land: (A) That application of existing development ordinances or regulations and other applicable law is inadequate to prevent irrevocable public harm from development in affected geographical areas; (B) That the moratorium is sufficiently limited to ensure that a needed supply of affected housing types and the supply of commercial and industrial facilities within or in proximity to the city, county or special district are not unreasonably restricted by the adoption of the moratorium; (C) Stating the reasons alternative methods of achieving the objectives of the moratorium are unsatisfactory; (D) That the city, county or special district has determined that the public harm which would be caused by failure to impose a moratorium outweighs the adverse effects on other affected local governments, including shifts in demand for housing or economic development, public facilities and services and buildable lands, and the overall impact of the moratorium on population distribution; and (E) That the city, county or special district proposing the moratorium has determined that sufficient resources are available to complete the development of needed interim or permanent changes in plans, regulations or procedures within the period of effectiveness of the moratorium. (b) For rural land: (A) That application of existing development ordinances or regulations and other applicable law is inadequate to prevent irrevocable public harm from development in affected geographical areas; (B) Stating the reasons alternative methods of achieving the objectives of the moratorium are unsatisfactory; (C) That the moratorium is sufficiently limited to ensure that lots or parcels outside the affected geographical areas are not unreasonably restricted by the adoption of the moratorium; and (D) That the city, county or special district proposing the moratorium has developed a work plan and time schedule for achieving the objectives of the moratorium. (4) No moratorium adopted under subsection (3)(a) of this section shall be effective for a period longer than 120 days, but such a moratorium may be extended provided the city, county or special district adopting the moratorium holds a public hearing on the proposed extension and adopts written findings that: (a) Verify the problem giving rise to the need for a moratorium still exists; (b) Demonstrate that reasonable progress is being made to alleviate the problem giving rise to the moratorium; and (c) Set a specific duration for the renewal of the moratorium. No extension may be for a period longer than six months. (5) Any city, county or special district considering an extension of a moratorium shall give the department at least 14 days notice of the time and date of the public hearing on the extension.",

(1) Before a local government adopts a change, including additions and deletions, to an acknowledged comprehensive plan or a land use regulation, the local government shall submit the proposed change to the Director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development. The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall specify, by rule, the deadline for submitting proposed changes, but in all cases the proposed change must be submitted at least 20 days before the local government holds the first evidentiary hearing on adoption of the proposed change. The commission may not require a local government to submit the proposed change more than 35 days before the first evidentiary hearing. (2) If a local government determines that emergency circumstances beyond the control of the local government require expedited review, the local government shall submit the proposed changes as soon as practicable, but may submit the proposed changes after the applicable deadline. (3) Submission of the proposed change must include all of the following materials: (a) The text of the proposed change to the comprehensive plan or land use regulation implementing the plan; (b) If a comprehensive plan map or zoning map is created or altered by the proposed change, a copy of the map that is created or altered; (c) A brief narrative summary of the proposed change and any supplemental information that the local government believes may be useful to inform the director or members of the public of the effect of the proposed change; (d) The date set for the first evidentiary hearing; (e) The form of notice or a draft of the notice to be provided under ORS 197.797, if applicable; and (f) Any staff report on the proposed change or information describing when the staff report will be available, and how a copy of the staff report can be obtained. (4) The director shall cause notice of the proposed change to the acknowledged comprehensive plan or the land use regulation to be provided to: (a) Persons that have requested notice of changes to the acknowledged comprehensive plan of the particular local government, using electronic mail, electronic bulletin board, electronic mailing list server or similar electronic method; and (b) Persons that are generally interested in changes to acknowledged comprehensive plans, by posting notices periodically on a public website using the Internet or a similar electronic method. (5) When a local government determines that the land use statutes, statewide land use planning goals and administrative rules of the commission that implement either the statutes or the goals do not apply to a proposed change to the acknowledged comprehensive plan and the land use regulations, submission of the proposed change under this section is not required. (6) If, after submitting the materials described in subsection (3) of this section, the proposed change is altered to such an extent that the materials submitted no longer reasonably describe the proposed change, the local government must notify the Department of Land Conservation and Development of the alterations to the proposed change and provide a summary of the alterations along with any alterations to the proposed text or map to the director at least 10 days before the final evidentiary hearing on the proposal. The director shall cause notice of the alterations to be given in the manner described in subsection (4) of this section. Circumstances requiring resubmission of a proposed change may include, but are not limited to, a change in the principal uses allowed under the proposed change or a significant change in the location at which the principal uses would be allowed, limited or prohibited. (7) When the director determines that a proposed change to an acknowledged comprehensive plan or a land use regulation may not be in compliance with land use statutes or the statewide land use planning goals, including administrative rules implementing either the statutes or the goals, the department shall notify the local government of the concerns at least 15 days before the final evidentiary hearing, unless there is only one hearing or the proposed change has been modified to the extent that resubmission is required under subsection (6) of this section. (8) Notwithstanding subsection (7) of this section, the department may provide advisory recommendations to the local government concerning the proposed change to the acknowledged comprehensive plan or land use regulation.",

(2) A county with a portion of its population within the urban growth boundary of a city subject to periodic review under this section shall conduct periodic review for that portion of the county according to the schedule and work program set for the city. (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, if the schedule set for the county is specific as to that portion of the county within the urban growth boundary of a city subject to periodic review under this section, the county shall conduct periodic review for that portion of the county according to the schedule and work program set for the county. (4) If the Land Conservation and Development Commission pays the costs of a local government that is not subject to subsection (1) of this section to perform new work programs and work tasks, the commission may require the local government to complete periodic review when the local government has not completed periodic review within the previous five years if: (a) A city has been growing faster than the annual population growth rate of the state for five consecutive years; (b) A major transportation project on the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program that is approved for funding by the Oregon Transportation Commission is likely to: (A) Have a significant impact on a city or an urban unincorporated community; or (B) Be significantly affected by growth and development in a city or an urban unincorporated community; (c) A major facility, including a prison, is sited or funded by a state agency; or (d) Approval by the city or county of a facility for a major employer will increase employment opportunities and significantly affect the capacity of housing and public facilities in the city or urban unincorporated community. (5) The Land Conservation and Development Commission may schedule periodic review for a local government earlier than provided in subsection (1) of this section if necessary to ensure that all local governments in a region whose land use decisions would significantly affect other local governments in the region are conducting periodic review concurrently, but not sooner than five years after completion of the previous periodic review. (6) A city or county that is not required to complete periodic review under subsection (1) of this section may request periodic review by the commission. (7) Upon request by a city, the Land Conservation and Development Commission may permit a city to undergo periodic review for the limited purpose of completing changes to proposed amendments to a comprehensive plan and land use regulations required on remand after review by the commission under ORS 197.626 (1)(b). If periodic review is initiated under this subsection, the city may adopt, and the Director of the Department of Land Conservation and Development may approve, a work program that includes only the changes required on remand.

The petition must be filed within 21 days after the date the commission delivered or mailed the order upon which the petition is based. (4) The filing of the petition, as set forth in subsection (3) of this section, and service of a petition on the persons who submitted oral or written testimony in the proceeding before the commission are jurisdictional and may not be waived or extended. (5) The petition must state the nature of the order the petitioner seeks to have reviewed. Copies of the petition must be served by registered or certified mail upon the commission and the persons who submitted oral or written testimony in the proceeding before the commission. (6) Within 21 days after service of the petition, the commission shall transmit to the Court of Appeals the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding under review. However, by stipulation of the parties to the review proceeding, the record may be shortened. The Court of Appeals may tax a party that unreasonably refuses to stipulate to limit the record for the additional costs. The Court of Appeals may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record. Except as specifically provided in this subsection, the Court of Appeals may not tax the cost of the record to the petitioner or an intervening party. However, the Court of Appeals may tax the costs to a party that files a frivolous petition for judicial review. (7) Petitions and briefs must be filed within time periods and in a manner established by the Court of Appeals by rule. (8) The Court of Appeals shall: (a) Hear oral argument within 49 days of the date of transmittal of the record unless the Court of Appeals determines that the ends of justice served by holding oral argument on a later day outweigh the best interests of the public and the parties. However, the Court of Appeals may not hold oral argument more than 49 days after the date of transmittal of the record because of general congestion of the court calendar or lack of diligent preparation or attention to the case by a member of the court or a party. (b) Set forth in writing and provide to the parties a determination to hear oral argument more than 49 days from the date the record is transmitted, together with the reasons for the determination. The Court of Appeals shall schedule oral argument as soon as is practicable. (c) Consider, in making a determination under paragraph (b) of this subsection: (A) Whether the case is so unusual or complex, due to the number of parties or the existence of novel questions of law, that 49 days is an unreasonable amount of time for the parties to brief the case and for the Court of Appeals to prepare for oral argument; and (B) Whether the failure to hold oral argument at a later date likely would result in a miscarriage of justice. (9) The court: (a) Shall limit judicial review of an order reviewed under this section to the record. (b) May not substitute its judgment for that of the Land Conservation and Development Commission as to an issue of fact. (10) The Court of Appeals may affirm, reverse or remand an order reviewed under this section. The Court of Appeals shall reverse or remand the order only if the court finds the order is: (a) Unlawful in substance or procedure. However, error in procedure is not cause for reversal or remand unless the Court of Appeals determines that substantial rights of the petitioner were prejudiced. (b) Unconstitutional. (c) Not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record as to facts found by the commission. (11) The Court of Appeals shall issue a final order on the petition for judicial review with the greatest possible expediency. (12) If the order of the commission is remanded by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, the commission shall respond to the courts appellate judgment within 30 days.

(2) The Department of Land Conservation and Development shall prepare a report stating whether the proposed changes comply with applicable statutes, goals and commission rules. The department shall provide a reasonable opportunity for persons to prepare and submit written comments or objections to the report; however a person may not: (a) Submit written comments or objections to the report unless the person participated orally or in writing in the local government proceedings leading to the adoption of the proposed changes. (b) Produce new evidence. (3) After reviewing the proposed changes, the report and any written comments and objections to the report, the commission shall prepare a proposed final order. The commission shall afford the local government and persons who submitted written comments or objections to the report a reasonable opportunity to file written exceptions to the proposed final order. If timely exceptions are not filed, the proposed order becomes final. (4) The commissions review under this section is confined to the record of proceedings before the local government, the report of the department and any comments, objections and exceptions filed under subsection (2) or (3) of this section and the proposed final order of the commission, including any responses to exceptions. The commission may entertain oral argument from the department and from persons who filed exceptions, and may consider new issues raised by its review. The commission may not allow additional evidence, argument or testimony that could have been presented to the local government but was not presented. (5) A commission order granting, denying or remanding proposed changes must include a clear statement of findings that sets forth the basis for the approval, denial or remand, including: (a) Identifying the statutes, goals and rules applicable to the proposed changes; and (b) Supporting the determinations of compliance and noncompliance. (6) A commission order granting approval may be limited to an identified geographic area described in the order if: (a) The identified geographic area is the only area that is the subject of the proposed changes; or (b) Specific geographic areas do not comply with the applicable statutes, goals or rules, and the requirements are not technical or minor in nature. (7) The commission may issue a limited approval order if a previously issued approval order is reversed or remanded by an appellate court. The limited approval order may deny approval of that part of the comprehensive plan or land use regulations that the court found not in compliance with the applicable statutes, goals or rules and grant approval of other parts of the proposed changes. (8) A limited approval order is an approval for all purposes and is a final order for purposes of judicial review with respect to the approved geographic area.

(b) Industrial use means industrial employment activities, including manufacturing, assembly, fabrication, processing, storage, logistics, warehousing, importation, distribution and transshipment and research and development. (c) Listed county means Baker, Gilliam, Grant, Harney, Lake, Malheur, Sherman, Union, Wallowa or Wheeler County. (d) Other employment use means all nonindustrial employment activities, including small scale commercial use, wholesale, service, nonprofit, business headquarters, administrative, governmental or employment activities that serve the medical, educational, social service, recreational or security industries and that occupy retail, office or flexible building types of any size or multibuilding campuses. (e) Reasonably be expected to expand or locate in the county means that the county possesses the appropriate locational factors for the use or category of use. (f)(A) Small scale commercial use means the low-impact use of land primarily for the retail sale of products or services, including offices. (B) Small scale commercial use does not include use of land for factories, warehouses, freight terminals or wholesale distribution centers. (2) A listed county that has adopted an economic opportunity analysis as part of its comprehensive plan may amend its comprehensive plan, land use regulations and zoning map to designate not more than 10 sites outside an urban growth boundary that cumulatively total not more than 50 acres of land if the sites were identified in any economic opportunity analysis as additional potential sites for industrial uses or other employment uses in order to allow for industrial uses and other employment uses without requiring an exception under ORS 197.732 to any statewide land use planning goals related to: (a) Agriculture; (b) Forest use; or (c) Urbanization. (3) A county may not designate a site under subsection (2) of this section: (a) On any lands designated as high-value farmland as defined in ORS 195.300; (b) Unless the county complies with ORS 197.714; and (c) If any portion of the proposed site is for lands designated for forest use, unless the county: (A) Notifies the State Forester in writing not less than 21 days before designating the site; and (B) Cooperates with the State Forester in: (i) Updating and classifying wildland-urban interface lands in and around the site; (ii) Taking necessary steps to implement or update the wildland-urban interface fire protection system in and around the site as described in ORS 477.027; and (iii) Implementing other fire protection measures authorized by the State Forester. (4) A county may not amend its comprehensive plan, land use regulations or zoning map under this section to allow a use that would conflict with an administrative rule adopted for the purpose of implementing the Oregon Sage-Grouse Action Plan and Executive Order 15-18.",

(2) Notwithstanding statewide land use planning goals protecting agricultural lands or forestlands or administrative rules implementing those goals, the governing body of a county may amend the countys comprehensive plan and land use regulations to allow an abandoned or diminished mill site to be zoned for industrial use. (3) Notwithstanding a statewide land use planning goal relating to urbanization or administrative rules implementing that goal, the governing body of a county may amend the countys comprehensive plan and land use regulations to allow an abandoned or diminished mill site to be zoned for any level of industrial use. (4) Notwithstanding a statewide land use planning goal relating to public facilities and services or administrative rules implementing that goal, the governing body of a county or its designee may approve: (a) The extension of sewer facilities to lands that on June 10, 2003, are zoned for industrial use and that contain an abandoned or diminished mill site.

The sewer facilities may serve only industrial uses authorized for the mill site and contiguous lands zoned for industrial use. (5)(a) A local government, as defined in ORS 174.116, may not authorize a connection to any portion of a sewer facility located between an urban growth boundary or the boundary of an unincorporated community and the boundary of the mill site or the industrial zone containing the mill site, except as provided under a statewide land use planning goal relating to public facilities and services or under ORS 197.732.

The presence of the sewer facilities may not be used to justify an exception to statewide land use planning goals protecting agricultural lands or forestlands or relating to urbanization. (6)(a) The governing body of a county or its designee shall determine the boundary of an abandoned or diminished mill site. For an abandoned or diminished mill site that is rezoned for industrial use under this section, land within the boundary of the mill site may include only those areas that were improved for the processing or manufacturing of wood products. (b) For an abandoned or diminished mill site subject to subsection (2), (3) or (4) of this section, the governing body of a city or county or its designee may approve a permit, as defined in ORS 215.402 or 227.160, only for industrial development and accessory uses subordinate to such development on the mill site. The governing body or its designee may not approve a permit for retail, commercial or residential development on the mill site.

(1) Within three years after June 28, 2011, in cooperation with local governments and private industry, the Economic Recovery Review Council, by rule, shall designate at least five and not more than 15 regionally significant industrial areas. The council shall base the designation of regionally significant industrial areas on the criteria in the definition of regionally significant industrial area and the judgment of the council concerning the relative importance of the areas in terms of potential, long-term job creation. (2) A local government may nominate a regionally significant industrial area for designation by the council. (3) An area containing multiple sites certified by the Oregon Business Development Department as ready for development within six months or less is eligible for designation by the council if the area is a regionally significant industrial area. (4) In addition to demonstrating compliance with other provisions of law, including, but not limited to, a statewide land use planning goal concerning economic development and rules implementing the goal, the future employment potential of a regionally significant industrial area shall be protected from conflicting development in the following ways: (a) A local government may not adopt a provision of a comprehensive plan or land use regulation that prevents industrial uses within the area. (b) A local government may not adopt a provision of a comprehensive plan or land use regulation that allows new nonindustrial uses within the area that conflict with existing or planned industrial uses. (c) A local government may not decrease the land area planned or zoned for industrial uses within the regionally significant industrial area. (d) A local government may adopt a provision of a comprehensive plan or land use regulation, including development standards or overlay zones, that restricts the type or extent of current or future industrial uses within the area, but only if the local government mitigates at the same time the effect of the new provision by: (A) Clearly maintaining or increasing the industrial employment potential of the area; and (B) Clearly maintaining the important site characteristics and functions that led to the designation of the site as a regionally significant industrial area. (5) Subsection (4) of this section does not apply to a provision of a comprehensive plan or land use regulation that is necessary: (a) To protect public health or safety; or (b) To implement federal law. (6) If 50 percent of the developable land within a regionally significant industrial area has not been developed within 10 years after designation of the area, the council shall remove the designation, unless landowners representing a majority of the land within the area request that the designation be continued. (7) Within a regionally significant industrial area, a new industrial use or the expansion of an existing industrial use is eligible for an expedited industrial land use permit issued under ORS 197.724 if the new or expanded use does not require a change to the acknowledged comprehensive plan or land use regulations. (8) In addition to other criteria for distribution of available funds, the Oregon Infrastructure Finance Authority and the Oregon Transportation Commission may consider the designation of an area as a regionally significant industrial area in prioritizing funding for transportation and other public infrastructure. (9) ORS 197.722 to 197.728 do not apply to land in the Willamette River Greenway Plan boundary between river mile 1 and river mile 11. [2011 c.564 7] Note: See note under",

The rules must allow for a rezoning that authorizes the change, continuation or expansion of an industrial use that has been in operation for the five years immediately preceding the formal land use planning action that was initiated for the change, continuation or expansion of use. (2) The rules adopted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section must provide that: (a) The rezoned use will maintain the land: (A) As rural land as described by commission rule; and (B) In a manner consistent with other statewide planning goal requirements; (b) The rural uses, density and public facilities and services permitted by the rezoning will not commit adjacent or other nearby resource land to uses that are not permitted by statewide planning goals related to agricultural and forest lands; (c) The rural uses, density and public facilities and services permitted by the rezoning are compatible with the uses of adjacent and other nearby resource land uses; and (d) The land to be rezoned is not in an area designated as a rural or urban reserve under ORS 197A.235.

      "text": "Local approval of emergency shelters; process; limitations. (1) A local government shall approve an application for the development or use of land for an emergency shelter, as defined in ORS 197.782, on any property, notwithstanding this chapter or ORS chapter 195, 197A, 215 or 227 or any statewide land use planning goal, rule of the Land Conservation and Development Commission or local land use regulation, zoning ordinance, regional framework plan, functional plan or comprehensive plan, if the emergency shelter: (a) Includes sleeping and restroom facilities for clients; (b) Will comply with applicable building codes; (c) Is located inside an urban growth boundary or in an area zoned for rural residential use as defined in ORS 215.501; (d) Will not result in the development of a new building that is sited within an area designated under a statewide planning goal relating to natural disasters and hazards, including flood plains or mapped environmental health hazards, unless the development complies with regulations directly related to the hazard; (e) Has adequate transportation access to commercial and medical services; and (f) Will not pose any unreasonable risk to public health or safety. (2) An emergency shelter allowed under this section must be operated by: (a) A local government as defined in ORS 174.116; (b) An organization with at least two years experience operating an emergency shelter using best practices that is: (A) A local housing authority as defined in ORS 456.375; (B) A religious corporation as defined in ORS 65.001; or (C) A public benefit corporation, as defined in ORS 65.001, whose charitable purpose includes the support of homeless individuals, that has been recognized as exempt from income tax under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for at least three years before the date of the application for a shelter; or (c) A nonprofit corporation partnering with any other entity described in this subsection. (3) An emergency shelter approved under this section: (a) May provide on-site for its clients and at no cost to the clients: (A) Showering or bathing; (B) Storage for personal property; (C) Laundry facilities; (D) Service of food prepared on-site or off-site; (E) Recreation areas for children and pets; (F) Case management services for housing, financial, vocational, educational or physical or behavioral health care services; or (G) Any other services incidental to shelter.

(b) A reviewing court shall award attorney fees to: (A) A local government, and any intervening applicant, that prevails on the appeal of a local governments approval; and (B) An applicant that prevails on an appeal of a local governments denial.

The following procedures shall govern the conduct of quasi-judicial land use hearings conducted before a local governing body, planning commission, hearings body or hearings officer on application for a land use decision and shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan and land use regulations: (1) An issue which may be the basis for an appeal to the Land Use Board of Appeals shall be raised not later than the close of the record at or following the final evidentiary hearing on the proposal before the local government. Such issues shall be raised and accompanied by statements or evidence sufficient to afford the governing body, planning commission, hearings body or hearings officer, and the parties an adequate opportunity to respond to each issue. (2)(a) Notice of the hearings governed by this section shall be provided to the applicant and to owners of record of property on the most recent property tax assessment roll where such property is located: (A) Within 100 feet of the property which is the subject of the notice where the subject property is wholly or in part within an urban growth boundary; (B) Within 250 feet of the property which is the subject of the notice where the subject property is outside an urban growth boundary and not within a farm or forest zone; or (C) Within 500 feet of the property which is the subject of the notice where the subject property is within a farm or forest zone. (b) Notice shall also be provided to any neighborhood or community organization recognized by the governing body and whose boundaries include the site. (c) At the discretion of the applicant, the local government also shall provide notice to the Department of Land Conservation and Development. (3) The notice provided by the jurisdiction shall: (a) Explain the nature of the application and the proposed use or uses which could be authorized; (b) List the applicable criteria from the ordinance and the plan that apply to the application at issue; (c) Set forth the street address or other easily understood geographical reference to the subject property; (d) State the date, time and location of the hearing; (e) State that failure of an issue to be raised in a hearing, in person or by letter, or failure to provide statements or evidence sufficient to afford the decision maker an opportunity to respond to the issue precludes appeal to the board based on that issue; (f) Be mailed at least: (A) Twenty days before the evidentiary hearing; or (B) If two or more evidentiary hearings are allowed, 10 days before the first evidentiary hearing; (g) Include the name of a local government representative to contact and the telephone number where additional information may be obtained; (h) State that a copy of the application, all documents and evidence submitted by or on behalf of the applicant and applicable criteria are available for inspection at no cost and will be provided at reasonable cost; (i) State that a copy of the staff report will be available for inspection at no cost at least seven days prior to the hearing and will be provided at reasonable cost; and (j) Include a general explanation of the requirements for submission of testimony and the procedure for conduct of hearings. (4)(a) All documents or evidence relied upon by the applicant shall be submitted to the local government and be made available to the public. (b) Any staff report used at the hearing shall be available at least seven days prior to the hearing. If additional documents or evidence are provided by any party, the local government may allow a continuance or leave the record open to allow the parties a reasonable opportunity to respond. Any continuance or extension of the record requested by an applicant shall result in a corresponding extension of the time limitations of ORS 215.427 or 227.178 and ORS 215.429 or 227.179. (5) At the commencement of a hearing under a comprehensive plan or land use regulation, a statement shall be made to those in attendance that: (a) Lists the applicable substantive criteria; (b) States that testimony, arguments and evidence must be directed toward the criteria described in paragraph (a) of this subsection or other criteria in the plan or land use regulation which the person believes to apply to the decision; and (c) States that failure to raise an issue accompanied by statements or evidence sufficient to afford the decision maker and the parties an opportunity to respond to the issue precludes appeal to the board based on that issue. (6)(a) Prior to the conclusion of the initial evidentiary hearing, any participant may request an opportunity to present additional evidence, arguments or testimony regarding the application. The local hearings authority shall grant such request by continuing the public hearing pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection or leaving the record open for additional written evidence, arguments or testimony pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection. (b) If the hearings authority grants a continuance, the hearing shall be continued to a date, time and place certain at least seven days from the date of the initial evidentiary hearing. An opportunity shall be provided at the continued hearing for persons to present and rebut new evidence, arguments or testimony. If new written evidence is submitted at the continued hearing, any person may request, prior to the conclusion of the continued hearing, that the record be left open for at least seven days to submit additional written evidence, arguments or testimony for the purpose of responding to the new written evidence. (c) If the hearings authority leaves the record open for additional written evidence, arguments or testimony, the record shall be left open for at least seven days. Any participant may file a written request with the local government for an opportunity to respond to new evidence submitted during the period the record was left open. If such a request is filed, the hearings authority shall reopen the record pursuant to subsection (7) of this section. (d) A continuance or extension granted pursuant to this section shall be subject to the limitations of ORS 215.427 or 227.178 and ORS 215.429 or 227.179, unless the continuance or extension is requested or agreed to by the applicant. (e) Unless waived by the applicant, the local government shall allow the applicant at least seven days after the record is closed to all other parties to submit final written arguments in support of the application. The applicants final submittal shall be considered part of the record, but shall not include any new evidence. This seven-day period shall not be subject to the limitations of ORS 215.427 or 227.178 and ORS 215.429 or 227.179. (7) When a local governing body, planning commission, hearings body or hearings officer reopens a record to admit new evidence, arguments or testimony, any person may raise new issues which relate to the new evidence, arguments, testimony or criteria for decision-making which apply to the matter at issue. (8) The failure of the property owner to receive notice as provided in this section shall not invalidate such proceedings if the local government can demonstrate by affidavit that such notice was given. The notice provisions of this section shall not restrict the giving of notice by other means, including posting, newspaper publication, radio and television. (9) For purposes of this section: (a) Argument means assertions and analysis regarding the satisfaction or violation of legal standards or policy believed relevant by the proponent to a decision. Argument does not include facts. (b) Evidence means facts, documents, data or other information offered to demonstrate compliance or noncompliance with the standards believed by the proponent to be relevant to the decision.

(3)(a) Jurisdiction for judicial review of proceedings under ORS 197.830 to 197.845 is conferred upon the Court of Appeals. Proceedings for judicial review are instituted by filing a petition in the Court of Appeals. The petition must be filed within 21 days following the date the board delivered or mailed the order upon which the petition is based. (b) Filing of the petition, as set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection, and service of a petition on all persons identified in the petition as adverse parties of record in the board proceeding is jurisdictional and may not be waived or extended. (4) The petition must state the nature of the order the petitioner desires reviewed. Copies of the petition must be served by first class, registered or certified mail on the board and all other parties of record in the board proceeding. (5) Within seven days after service of the petition, the board shall transmit to the court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding under review, but, by stipulation of all parties to the review proceeding, the record may be shortened. The court may tax a party that unreasonably refuses to stipulate to limit the record for the additional costs. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record when deemed desirable. Except as specifically provided in this subsection, the court may not tax the cost of the record to the petitioner or any intervening party. However, the court may tax such costs and the cost of transcription of record to a party filing a frivolous petition for judicial review. (6) Petitions and briefs must be filed within time periods and in a manner established by the Court of Appeals by rule. (7)(a) The court shall hear oral argument within 49 days of the date of transmittal of the record. (b) The court may hear oral argument more than 49 days from the date of transmittal of the record provided the court determines that the ends of justice served by holding oral argument on a later day outweigh the best interests of the public and the parties. The court may not hold oral argument more than 49 days from the date of transmittal of the record because of general congestion of the court calendar or lack of diligent preparation or attention to the case by any member of the court or any party. (c) The court shall set forth in writing a determination to hear oral argument more than 49 days from the date the record is transmitted, together with the reasons for its determination, and shall provide a copy to the parties. The court shall schedule oral argument as soon as practicable thereafter. (d) In making a determination under paragraph (b) of this subsection, the court shall consider: (A) Whether the case is so unusual or complex, due to the number of parties or the existence of novel questions of law, that 49 days is an unreasonable amount of time for the parties to brief the case and for the court to prepare for oral argument; and (B) Whether the failure to hold oral argument at a later date likely would result in a miscarriage of justice. (8) Judicial review of an order issued under ORS 197.830 to 197.845 must be confined to the record. The court may not substitute its judgment for that of the board as to any issue of fact. (9) The court may affirm, reverse or remand the order. The court shall reverse or remand the order only if it finds: (a) The order to be unlawful in substance or procedure, but error in procedure is not cause for reversal or remand unless the court finds that substantial rights of the petitioner were prejudiced thereby; (b) The order to be unconstitutional; or (c) The order is not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record as to facts found by the board under ORS 197.835 (2). (10) The Court of Appeals shall issue a final order on the petition for judicial review with the greatest possible expediency. (11) If the order of the board is remanded by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, the board shall respond to the courts appellate judgment within 30 days. (12) A party must file with the board an undertaking with one or more sureties insuring that the party will pay all costs, disbursements and attorney fees awarded against the party by the Court of Appeals if: (a) The party appealed a decision of the board to the Court of Appeals; and (b) In making the decision being appealed to the Court of Appeals, the board awarded attorney fees and expenses against that party under ORS 197.830 (15)(b) or (c). (13) Upon entry of its final order, the court shall award attorney fees and expenses to a party who: (a) Prevails on a claim that an approval condition imposed by a local government on an application for a permit pursuant to ORS 215.416 or 227.175 is unconstitutional under section 18, Article I, Oregon Constitution, or the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution; or (b) Is entitled to attorney fees under ORS 197.843. (14) The undertaking required in subsection (12) of this section must be filed with the board and served on the opposing parties within 10 days after the date the petition was filed with the Court of Appeals.",

Reasonably severable means the remaining parts, standing alone, are complete and capable of being executed with the legislative intent. The affirmed parts are not affected by the reversal or remand, continue in effect and are considered acknowledged as described in ORS 197.625. (c) The board shall adopt rules defining the circumstances in which it will reverse rather than remand a land use decision or limited land use decision or part of a decision that is not affirmed. (2)(a) Review of a decision under ORS 197.830 to 197.845 shall be confined to the record. (b) In the case of disputed allegations of standing, unconstitutionality of the decision, ex parte contacts, actions described in subsection (10)(a)(B) of this section or other procedural irregularities not shown in the record that, if proved, would warrant reversal or remand, the board may take evidence and make findings of fact on those allegations. The board shall be bound by any finding of fact of the local government, special district or state agency for which there is substantial evidence in the whole record. (3) The board may only review issues raised by any participant before the local hearings body as provided by ORS 197.195, 197.622 or 197.797, whichever is applicable. (4) A petitioner may raise new issues to the board regarding a quasi-judicial decision made under ORS 197.195 or 197.797 only if: (a) The local government failed to list the applicable criteria for a decision under ORS 197.195 (3)(c) or 197.797 (3)(b), in which case a petitioner may raise new issues based upon applicable criteria that were omitted from the notice. However, the board may refuse to allow new issues to be raised if it finds that the issue could have been raised before the local government; or (b) The local government made a land use decision or limited land use decision which is different from the proposal described in the notice to such a degree that the notice of the proposed action did not reasonably describe the local governments final action.
