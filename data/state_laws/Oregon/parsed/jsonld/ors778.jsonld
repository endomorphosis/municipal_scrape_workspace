The board may, in addition thereto, pledge or mortgage for the payment of the principal of and interest on and premium, if any, of any issue of such bonds any property of the port not pledged for other purposes. Notice that action upon the bond ordinance will be taken at the designated meeting of the board, shall be given for a period of not less than two consecutive weeks, prior to such meeting, by publication thereof once each week in a newspaper of general circulation, published within the corporate boundaries of the port or, if there be no such newspaper, by posting such notice for a period of not less than two weeks in three public places in the port. (2) The money in any special trust fund created by an ordinance authorizing an issue of revenue bonds shall be used solely for the purposes provided therefor by the ordinance. (3) The ordinance may obligate the port, and the port shall have power to fix, levy and collect such rates, rentals, fees and other charges for the use and services of all or any of its facilities, which revenues may be pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on and premium, if any, of the revenue bonds or any of them and if so pledged shall be sufficient to produce revenues, along with other lawfully available funds, adequate to pay the costs of the operation, maintenance and repair of any or all port properties; to pay or provide for the payment of the principal of and interest on, and premium, if any, of such revenue bonds or any of them, including any reserves for such payment; and to produce such additional amount of revenues therefrom as the port may covenant with the holders of such revenue bonds. (4) The ordinance may provide that in the event the money in a special trust fund is insufficient to pay the revenue bonds to be paid out of the fund, such revenue bonds shall be payable out of any part or all of other nonpledged revenues of the port. Whenever all bonds and expenses thereof have been paid so that no charge remains upon such special fund, the board may, by ordinance, transfer any balance remaining in such fund to its general fund, discharge the trustee, if any, and dissolve the special fund. Any trustee authorized to administer the fund, may, subject to approval of the board, invest and reinvest moneys in the special fund in any security or securities in which the State of Oregon may by law invest. (5) If the board fails to set aside and pay revenues into a special trust fund as required by the ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of the bonds secured by the fund, a holder of any of such bonds may bring suit against the port to compel compliance with the provisions of the ordinance in the circuit court of the county in which the port has its principal office.",

(2) Except as otherwise provided by this section, in order to be effective, all ordinances require the affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners of the port at a meeting of the board duly and regularly held. (3) Ordinances making appropriations, the annual tax levy and emergency ordinances take effect immediately upon passage. All other ordinances are subject to the referendum and shall become effective 30 days after enacted, unless a later date is fixed therein, in which event they shall take effect at a later date, subject to the referendum. Except for ordinances making appropriations and the annual tax levy, when an ordinance is enacted, a notice containing a concise summary of the ordinance and the location within the port where a copy of the complete ordinance may be obtained without charge shall, within five days after passage of the ordinance, be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation within the port. (4) Ordinances making appropriations and the annual tax levy and emergency ordinances shall be passed by an aye and nay vote. Emergency ordinances shall contain the statement that an emergency exists and specify with distinctness the facts and reasons constituting the emergency. The unanimous vote of all the commissioners present, and of not less than seven commissioners, is required to pass an emergency ordinance. (5) In case a referendum petition is filed against an ordinance or part thereof, the operation of the ordinance or part thereof shall be suspended pending the outcome of the referendum election.",
