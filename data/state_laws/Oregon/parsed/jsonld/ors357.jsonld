The Interstate Library Compact hereby is enacted into law and entered into by this state with all states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows: ______________________________________________________________________________ ARTICLE I POLICY AND PURPOSE Because the desire for the services provided by libraries transcends governmental boundaries and can most effectively be satisfied by giving such services to communities and people regardless of jurisdictional lines, it is the policy of the states party to this compact to cooperate and share their responsibilities; to authorize cooperation and sharing with respect to those types of library facilities and services which can be more economically or efficiently developed and maintained on a cooperative basis; and to authorize cooperation and sharing among localities, states and others in providing joint or cooperative library services in areas where the distribution of population or of existing and potential library resources make the provision of library service on an interstate basis the most effective way of providing adequate and efficient service. ARTICLE II DEFINITIONS As used in this compact: (a) Public library agency means any unit or agency of local or state government operating or having power to operate a library. (b) Private library agency means any nongovernmental entity which operates or assumes a legal obligation to operate a library. (c) Library agreement means a contract establishing an interstate library district pursuant to this compact or providing for the joint or cooperative furnishing of library services. ARTICLE III INTERSTATE LIBRARY DISTRICTS (a) Any one or more public library agencies in a party state in cooperation with any public library agency or agencies in one or more other party states may establish and maintain an interstate library district. Subject to the provisions of this compact and any other laws of the party states which pursuant hereto remain applicable, such district may establish, maintain and operate some or all of the library facilities and services for the area concerned in accordance with the terms of a library agreement therefor. Any private library agency or agencies within an interstate library district may cooperate therewith, assume duties, responsibilities and obligations thereto, and receive benefits therefrom as provided in any library agreement to which such agency or agencies become party.

(c) No library agreement shall become effective until filed with the compact administrator of each state involved, and approved in accordance with Article VII of this compact. ARTICLE VII APPROVAL OF LIBRARY AGREEMENTS (a) Every library agreement made pursuant to this compact shall, prior to and as a condition precedent to its entry into force, be submitted to the attorney general of each state in which a public library agency party thereto is situated, who shall determine whether the agreement is in proper form and compatible with the laws of the state of the attorney general. The attorneys general shall approve any agreement submitted to them unless they shall find that it does not meet the conditions set forth herein and shall detail in writing addressed to the governing bodies of the public library agencies concerned the specific respects in which the proposed agreement fails to meet the requirements of law. Failure to disapprove an agreement submitted hereunder within 90 days of its submission shall constitute approval thereof. (b) In the event that a library agreement made pursuant to this compact shall deal in whole or in part with the provision of services or facilities with regard to which an officer or agency of the state government has constitutional or statutory powers of control, the agreement shall, as a condition precedent to its entry into force, be submitted to the state officer or agency having such power of control and shall be approved or disapproved by the state officer or agency as to all matters within the state officers or agencys jurisdiction in the same manner and subject to the same requirements governing the action of the attorneys general pursuant to paragraph (a) of this article. This requirement of submission and approval shall be in addition to and not in substitution for the requirement of submission to and approval by the attorneys general. ARTICLE VIII OTHER LAWS APPLICABLE Nothing in this compact or in any library agreement shall be construed to supersede, alter or otherwise impair any obligation imposed on any library by otherwise applicable law, nor to authorize the transfer or disposition of any property held in trust by a library agency in a manner contrary to the terms of such trust. ARTICLE IX APPROPRIATIONS AND AID (a) Any public library agency party to a library agreement may appropriate funds to the interstate library district established thereby in the same manner and to the same extent as to a library wholly maintained by it and, subject to the laws of the state in which such public library agency is situated, may pledge its credit in support of an interstate library district established by the agreement. (b) Subject to the provisions of the library agreement pursuant to which it functions and the laws of the states in which such district is situated, an interstate library district may claim and receive any state and federal aid which may be available to library agencies. ARTICLE X COMPACT ADMINISTRATOR Each state shall designate a compact administrator with whom copies of all library agreements to which the administrators state or any public library agency thereof is party shall be filed. The administrator shall have such other powers as may be conferred upon the administrator by the laws of the state of the administrator and may consult and cooperate with the compact administrators of other party states and take such steps as may effectuate the purposes of this compact. If the laws of a party state so provide, such state may designate one or more deputy compact administrators in addition to its compact administrator. ARTICLE XI ENTRY INTO FORCE AND WITHDRAWAL (a) This compact shall enter into force and effect immediately upon its enactment into law by any two states. Thereafter, it shall enter into force and effect as to any other state upon the enactment thereof by such state. (b) This compact shall continue in force with respect to a party state and remain binding upon such state until six months after such state has given notice to each other party state of the repeal thereof. Such withdrawal shall not be construed to relieve any party to a library agreement entered into pursuant to this compact from any obligation of that agreement prior to the end of its duration as provided therein. ARTICLE XII CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters. ______________________________________________________________________________ [1965 c.354 2] Note: For ratification of the Interstate Library Compact by Idaho legislature, see chapter 252, Idaho Laws, 1965, effective May 17, 1965.

(d) Where public library services are not provided as described in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this subsection, but are provided by a county or district library that has a valid contract with one or more libraries to provide persons in their jurisdiction with library services, there shall be paid to the county or district library a per capita amount for each child residing therein, exclusive of the populations served by libraries eligible for grants under paragraph (c) of this subsection.
