Juveniles may not be placed in facilities that are designated for isolation of adult prisoners in order to meet this standard; (d) Provide for unrestricted contact between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. for a period of not less than five hours per day between detained juveniles and their attorneys and unrestricted attorney access to the facility for private attorney-client consultation; (e) Unless otherwise ordered by the juvenile court following a hearing, provide for the private and unrestricted receipt of and sending of mail; except that incoming mail may be opened in the presence of the juvenile upon reasonable suspicion to believe that the mail contains contraband as defined in ORS 162.135 (1) and that incoming packages shall be opened in the presence of the juvenile and their contents may be held until the juvenile is released. The juvenile shall be informed of any confiscated contraband; (f) Provide for the payment of postage for the juveniles mail to an attorney or to federal, state, county or municipal government officials; (g) Provide for nondispositional counseling and physical exercise of any juvenile held in excess of five judicial days and cause access to the juvenile held in excess of five judicial days for education pursuant to ORS 336.585; (h) Provide for the free exercise of religion by a detained juvenile, unless such provision will cause a threat to the security of the facility or a threat of disorderly conduct within the facility; (i) Make a written report, one copy of which shall be maintained in a general log, of each use of physical force, restraint, isolation, roomlock or internal search, setting forth in detail the reason such action was taken and the name of the staff person taking such action; (j) Notify the attorney and the parent or guardian of the detained juvenile after the use of any physical force, restraint, isolation or internal search upon the juvenile both: (A) As soon as reasonable after the use thereof; and (B) By mailing a copy of the written report within 24 hours after the use thereof; (k) For juveniles detained in an adult correctional facility, provide for in-person contact by juvenile department staff within 24 hours of the juveniles admission and on a daily basis for as long as the juvenile shall remain in the facility; and (L) Provide for counseling of any detained juvenile found to be within the jurisdiction of the court.

A use of force or other physical means of control may not employ: (a) The use of restraining devices for a purpose other than to prevent physical injury or escape, or, in any case, for a period in excess of six hours. However, the time during which a detained juvenile is being transported to another facility pursuant to court order shall not be counted within the six hours; or (b) Isolation for a period in excess of six hours; (3) Use roomlock except for the discipline and punishment of a detained juvenile for violation of a rule of conduct or behavior of the facility as provided for in ORS 169.076 (12) or for conduct that constitutes a crime under the laws of this state or that would justify physical force, control or isolation under subsection (2) of this section; (4) Cause to be made an internal examination of a detained juveniles anus or vagina, except upon probable cause that contraband, as defined in ORS 162.135 (1), will be found upon such examination and then only by a physician licensed under ORS chapter 677, naturopathic physician licensed under ORS chapter 685, physician assistant licensed under ORS 677.505 to 677.525 or nurse licensed under ORS chapter 678; (5)(a) Administer to any detained juvenile medication, except upon the informed consent of the juvenile or in the case of an imminent threat to the life of the juvenile or where the juvenile has a contagious or communicable disease that poses an imminent threat to the health of other persons in the facility. However, prescription medication may not be administered except upon a written prescription or written order by a physician licensed under ORS chapter 677, physician assistant licensed under ORS 677.505 to 677.525, nurse practitioner licensed under ORS 678.375 to 678.390, naturopathic physician licensed under ORS chapter 685 or dentist licensed under ORS chapter 679, and administered by a person authorized under ORS chapter 677, 678 or 679 to administer medication. Facility staff not otherwise authorized by law to administer medications may administer noninjectable medications in accordance with rules adopted by the Oregon State Board of Nursing pursuant to ORS 678.150 (8); (b) Nonmedical personnel shall receive training for administering medications, including recognition of and response to drug reactions and unanticipated side effects, from the responsible physician, physician assistant, naturopathic physician or nurse and the official responsible for the facility. All personnel shall be responsible for administering the dosage medications according to orders and for recording the administrations of the dosage in a manner and on a form approved by the responsible physician, physician assistant, naturopathic physician or nurse practitioner; and (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, medication may not be administered unless a physician, physician assistant licensed under ORS 677.505 to 677.525, naturopathic physician licensed under ORS chapter 685 or nurse licensed under ORS chapter 678 is either physically on the premises or readily available by telephone and within 30 minutes travel time of the patient; (6) Administer to any detained juvenile any medication or medical procedure for purposes of experimentation; (7) Discipline or punish any juvenile for conduct or behavior by roomlock, for a period in excess of 12 hours, or by denial of any privilege, regularly awarded other detained adults or juveniles, for more than one day, except after: (a) Advising the juvenile in writing of the alleged offensive conduct or behavior; (b) Providing the juvenile the opportunity to a hearing before a staff member who was not a witness to the alleged offensive conduct or behavior; (c) Providing the juvenile the opportunity to produce witnesses and evidence and to cross-examine witnesses; (d) Providing the detained juvenile the opportunity to testify, at the sole option of the juvenile; and (e) A finding that the alleged conduct or behavior was proven by a preponderance of the evidence and that it violated a rule of conduct or behavior of the facility as provided for in ORS 169.076 (12) or constituted a crime under the laws of this state; and (8) Detain juveniles with emotional disturbances, mental retardation or physical disabilities on the same charges and circumstances for which other juveniles would have been released or provided with another alternative.",
