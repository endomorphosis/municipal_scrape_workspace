A local government has concurrent authority with the State Fire Marshal to enforce State Fire Marshal storage requirements within the jurisdiction of the local government.

(1) The installer shall notify the State Fire Marshal, before the last day of each month, of all new installations made during the preceding month of containers or receptacles for liquefied petroleum gas, including installations for private homes and apartments. The installer shall certify on a form provided by the State Fire Marshal that all of the new installations are duly and properly reported. The State Fire Marshal may require that the notification include the location and description of the installation and the name of the user. All fees due and payable must accompany the notification. The replacement of empty containers or receptacles with other containers constructed in accordance with United States Department of Transportation specifications is not a new installation or change in the original installation that requires notification to the State Fire Marshal or necessitates further inspection of the installation. The State Fire Marshal shall collect from the installer an installation fee of $50 for each tank installed or for all tanks at the installation if the total combined capacity is 200 gallons or less. The State Fire Marshal or deputies of the fire marshal or assistants shall inspect a reasonable number of the installations and maintain a record of the inspections in the records of the Department of the State Fire Marshal. (2) In addition to any installation or inspection fee, the State Fire Marshal may charge a plan review fee, not to exceed $100, for any liquefied petroleum gas container and receptacle plan review required under a uniform fire code prescribed by the State Fire Marshal by rule. (3) After the initial installation, liquefied petroleum gas containers may be inspected once every 10 years except when changes have been made in the original installation. An installer making changes must notify the State Fire Marshal of the changes in the same manner provided in this section for new installations. The State Fire Marshal shall collect from the owner a fee of $50 for the inspection of each container. The manner of inspection, requirement of corrections, satisfaction of requirements and collection of fees due and payable must conform with the provisions of ORS 480.410 to 480.460 for new installations. Upon request of the State Fire Marshal, LP gas installation licensees shall furnish a list of the locations of 10-year old installations that they service. (4) If, upon inspection of any tank, the new installation does not comply with the requirements of the State Fire Marshal, the State Fire Marshal shall instruct the installer as to what corrections are necessary for compliance with the State Fire Marshals requirements. The installer of the new installation shall, within the time set by the State Fire Marshal, not to exceed 60 days after notification, notify the State Fire Marshal that the new installation complies with the requirements of the fire marshal. If the installer fails to notify the State Fire Marshal, or the State Fire Marshal has reason to believe that the corrections have not been made, the State Fire Marshal shall reinspect the new installation and shall collect from the installer an additional fee of $125. The user, not the installer, shall pay the additional fee resulting from actions of the user that require correction to achieve compliance with the requirements of the State Fire Marshal. (5) A person who receives notice from the State Fire Marshal must correct any improper installation within the time set by the State Fire Marshal, not to exceed 60 days after receipt of the notice. (6) If the fees provided for in this section are due and payable and are not paid within 30 days after service of written notice by the State Fire Marshal therefor, or if the installer fails to notify the State Fire Marshal by the last day of the month succeeding the month a new installation is made or a change is made requiring an inspection, the fees are delinquent and a penalty equal to the greater of 10 percent of the fee amount or $30, is imposed for the delinquency. The State Fire Marshal shall collect all fees and penalties in the name of the State of Oregon in the same manner that other debts are collected. (7) The provisions of this section do not apply to liquefied petroleum gas installations if made entirely within the jurisdiction of a governmental subdivision granted the exemption provided by ORS 476.030 (3) and written evidence of the licensing of the installation by the approved authority is submitted to the State Fire Marshal. The provisions of this section do not apply to LP gas installations made in manufactured dwellings that are constructed or altered in accordance with applicable rules of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. The provisions of this section do not apply to LP gas installations in a recreational vehicle as defined in ORS 174.101.",

To accomplish this purpose the Legislative Assembly intends by ORS 480.510 to 480.670 to provide a system: (1) For determining where and by whom boilers and pressure vessels are being constructed, installed, repaired, used and operated. (2) To ensure that only qualified persons do welding on boilers and on pressure vessels. (3) To ensure that boilers and pressure vessels are manufactured, installed, repaired, operated, inspected and maintained so as to meet the minimum safety standards formulated and promulgated by the Board of Boiler Rules. (4) For the administration and enforcement of ORS 480.510 to 480.670 by the Department of Consumer and Business Services and the board.

(2) Notwithstanding ORS 480.595 and except as provided in this subsection, the installing, altering or repairing contractor or the owner or user of any boiler or pressure vessel that is inspected under ORS 480.570 (1) or (2) shall pay an installation permit fee of $40 and an operating permit fee of $40. The Department of Consumer and Business Services may establish operating permit cycles by rule. The department may require payment of an installation or operating permit fee as provided in ORS 480.595 if the department finds that the boiler or pressure vessel is in violation of the minimum safety standards. (3) If an insurance company notifies its insured that the insurance company will no longer insure a boiler or pressure vessel, or that insurance on a boiler or pressure vessel is no longer in force, the insurance company shall also notify the chief boiler inspector, in a form and manner prescribed by the chief boiler inspector, of the description and vessel registration numbers of the boilers or pressure vessels for which insurance is canceled or suspended or is not to be renewed. (4) If an owner or user of a boiler or pressure vessel fails to pay any fee required by this chapter within 90 days after the billing date, the department may consider the fee delinquent and double the amount of the fee. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to the department if the department prevails in an action to collect a fee required by this chapter. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to a defendant who prevails in an action to collect a fee required by this chapter if the court determines that the department had no objectively reasonable basis for asserting the claim or no reasonable basis for appealing an adverse decision of the trial court.",
