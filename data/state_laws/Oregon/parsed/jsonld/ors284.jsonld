The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that: (1) Travel and recreation industries are important to the State of Oregon as a whole, and the health of these industries affects the well-being of all Oregonians. (2) Tourist facilities and attractions serve the recreational and cultural needs of both visitors and residents. (3) It is in the public interest to encourage the orderly growth and development of nonpolluting, labor-intensive industries such as tourism within the state. (4) The travel and recreation industries have become increasingly important to the economic growth of the state and will become more important in the future because of increased leisure time and declining employment opportunities in other traditional Oregon industries. (5) State involvement in tourism, recreational and cultural activities needs to be better coordinated to respond effectively to state interests and, where appropriate, to meet the needs of local governments and the private sector. (6) There is a need to encourage communication, partnership and cooperation between the public and private sectors of the industry to promote orderly growth and implementation of statewide objectives. (7) It is desirable that there be an agency in state government to act in matters pertaining to public relations. (8) It is in the public interest to promote quality, integrity and reliability in all tourism and tourism related services and in information offered to visitors to the State of Oregon. (9) Oregonians want to preserve the historical and cultural foundations of the state as a living part of community life and development and to insure future generations and visitors the opportunity to appreciate and enjoy the rich heritage of Oregon. (10) Planning and promotion of tourism and recreation should be compatible with other state interests in energy development and conservation, environmental protection, transportation and the judicious use of natural resources. (11) It is in the best interest of the nation and the tourism and recreation industries to proceed in an orderly fashion toward the development of a promotional program for advancing and enhancing tourism in the state.

The concept of manufacturing business ecosystems has become relevant as the focus of economic development in manufacturing sectors extends to regional economic communities of interacting organizations and individuals who produce and consume goods and services in a specified region. Such manufacturing business ecosystems include suppliers, lead producers, competitors, investors, consumers and other stakeholders. (2) Over time, manufacturing business ecosystems evolve as members share capabilities and resources and align objectives. Such manufacturing business ecosystems enable regions of similar focus and interests to share visions, align investments and provide mutually supportive roles that benefit the entire region, resulting in job creation and maintenance, leverage of advantages and opportunities, coordination of research and commercialization, acceleration of new technologies across manufacturing industries, growth of small- and medium-sized businesses, collaborative development of public infrastructure and increased access to capital. (3) Providing legislative support to the efforts of manufacturing business ecosystems and designating an entity to unify efforts, provide oversight and leverage regional resources and strengths, are appropriate and innovative means of moving forward with manufacturing economic development in Oregon. (4) There has been extensive progress toward creating a manufacturing business ecosystem, called the Pacific Northwest Manufacturing Partnership, in the southwest part of the State of Washington and the geographic region located within the Willamette Valley and the Columbia River corridor in Oregon. The partnership was formed in response to a federal initiative known as the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership program in the United States Economic Development Administration which aims to accelerate the resurgence of manufacturing in the United States. The federal initiative seeks to encourage communities to develop comprehensive economic development strategies and best practices that will strengthen the communities competitive edge for attracting global manufacturer and supply chain investments. The partnership will make application to the federal initiative program for a federal designation as a manufacturing community in accordance with the program requirements and geographical limitations. The partnership is an example of the type of business ecosystem that this state should encourage and support, and may serve as a model for future partnerships for manufacturing economic development in other regions of this state and the Pacific Northwest.",

(b) After determining that a proposal, grant, loan or equity investment is eligible for revenue bond financing under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the department shall forward a request for the issuance of revenue bonds to the State Treasurer. (2) The State Treasurer may issue revenue bonds subject to the budget authorization for bond issuance established under ORS 286A.035 for the department and the council for the purpose of financing or refinancing, in whole or part, grants, loans and equity investments made under ORS 284.742, plus an additional amount to be estimated by the State Treasurer for payment of bond-related costs. (3) Net proceeds of the revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section must be deposited in the Oregon Innovation Bond Fund established under ORS 284.747 for disbursement to the council to finance the making of grants, loans and equity investments under ORS 284.742. (4) Bond-related costs must be paid from the gross proceeds of the revenue bonds issued under this section and from moneys deposited in an account or subaccount of the Oregon Innovation Fund that has been established by the council specifically for this purpose.

(6) Revenue bonds issued under this section: (a) Are payable from the moneys deposited in an account or subaccount of the Oregon Innovation Fund that has been established by the council specifically for the purpose of making payments on revenue bonds issued under this section. (b) Do not constitute a debt or general obligation of the state, the Legislative Assembly or a political subdivision of this state but are secured solely by: (A) The moneys deposited in an account or subaccount of the Oregon Innovation Fund that has been established by the council specifically for the purpose of making payments on revenue bonds issued under this section; (B) Amounts in a debt service reserve account established with respect to revenue bonds issued under this section; or (C) A credit enhancement obtained for the revenue bonds issued under this section.

The lien and pledge are valid and binding from the date of issuance of the revenue bonds and are automatically perfected without physical delivery, filing or other act. The lien and pledge are superior to subsequent claims or liens on the moneys deposited in the Oregon Innovation Fund.

      "text": "Residency preference for civil service positions in region. (1) As used in this section: (a) Civil service position means any position, regardless of whether it is labeled a civil service position, for which a hiring or promotion decision is made or required to be made based on the results of a merit based, competitive process that includes, but is not limited to, consideration of an applicants or employees relative ability, knowledge, experience and other skills. (b) Public employer means a public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, and any person authorized to act on behalf of the public body, with respect to the control, management or supervision of any employee of the public body. (c) Resident applicant means an applicant for a civil service position whose primary residence is located in Malheur County. (2) This section applies to a civil service position if the majority of the work of the position will be performed within the Eastern Oregon Border Economic Development Region. (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b) of this section, a public employer shall grant a preference to any resident applicant for a vacant civil service position, or for promotion to a civil service position with a higher maximum salary rate, who: (a)(A) Successfully completes an initial application screening or an application examination for the position; or (B) Successfully completes a civil service test the public employer administers to establish eligibility for the position; and (b) Meets the minimum qualifications and any special qualifications for the position. (4) The public employer shall grant the preference in the following manner: (a) For an initial application screening used to develop a list of persons for interviews, the public employer shall add five percentage points to a resident applicants score. (b) For an application examination, given after the initial application screening, that results in a score, the public employer shall add five percentage points to the total combined examination score of a resident applicant without allocating the points to any single feature or part of the examination. (c) For an application examination that consists of an interview, an evaluation of the resident applicants performance, experience or training, a supervisors rating or any other method of ranking an applicant that does not result in a score, the public employer shall give a preference to the resident applicant. A public employer that uses an application examination of the type described in this paragraph shall devise and apply methods by which the public employer gives special consideration in the public employers hiring decision to resident applicants. (5) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, the system of giving preferences under this section does not require a public employer to appoint a resident applicant to a civil service position. (6) A public employer shall appoint an otherwise qualified resident applicant to a vacant civil service position if the results of the resident applicants application examination, when combined with the resident applicants preference percentage points, are equal to or higher than the results of an application examination for an applicant who is not a resident applicant. (7)(a) A resident applicant who is appointed to a civil service position under this section must maintain residency in Malheur County for at least five consecutive years following the date on which the employment begins. Failure to maintain residency in Malheur County for this period shall be considered a voluntary termination of the employment. (b) Paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply to a resident applicant who elects in writing at the beginning of the application process to forgo the preference available under this section. (c) The Eastern Oregon Border Economic Development Board, in consultation with the governing body of Malheur County, may prescribe a method by which employees holding civil service positions described in subsection (2) of this section who received a preference under this section annually notify their employers of the county in which their primary residence is located. The notice shall include any documentation the board considers necessary to confirm the residency and shall be made under penalties for false swearing under ORS 162.075. (8) Violation of this section is an unlawful employment practice. (9) A resident applicant claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of this section may file a verified written complaint with the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries in accordance with ORS 659A.820. (10) Nothing in this section precludes or preempts the policy of a jurisdiction, any part of which is located within the Eastern Oregon Border Economic Development Region, that is equally or more protective of local applicants for civil service positions.",
