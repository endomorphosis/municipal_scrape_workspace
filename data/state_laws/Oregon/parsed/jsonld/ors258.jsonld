(2) An elector may file a demand requiring the Secretary of State to direct that a recount be made in specified precincts in which votes were cast on any measure which appeared on the ballot. (3) A county clerk may file a demand requiring the Secretary of State to direct that a recount be made in specified precincts in which votes were cast for the nomination or office for which a candidate received a vote or on any measure that appeared on the ballot. The cash deposit requirement of subsection (5) of this section shall not apply to a demand made under this subsection. The cost of a recount conducted under this subsection shall be paid by the county of the county clerk making the demand. (4) Except as provided in subsection (9) of this section, the person making a demand for a recount may, in the first demand, specify a partial or a full recount. A person making a demand for a partial recount shall specify the precincts in which votes were cast for the nomination or office or on the measure to be recounted. If in the first demand the person requested a partial recount, the person may file a supplemental demand for a recount of all the remainder of the precincts. (5) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (6) of this section, each demand shall be accompanied by a cash deposit of $15 for each precinct to be recounted up to a maximum of $8,000 for a recount of all precincts in the state on a measure or for a nomination or office. The Secretary of State may retain the deposit for not more than 60 days after the election for which the recount was demanded, without depositing it in the General Fund. (6) Upon application from a county clerk, the Secretary of State may waive the cash deposit requirement of subsection (5) of this section if, after the first demand, it appears that due to nondeliberate and material error by a local elections official, as defined in ORS 246.012, or a county clerk, the outcome of an election on a candidate or measure will be changed. The cost of a recount conducted under this subsection shall be paid by the county of the county clerk or the county of the local elections official who committed the error. (7) Each demand shall be in the form and shall contain the information prescribed by the Secretary of State, including the names and addresses of all persons and organizations providing any part of the cash deposit and the amount provided by each. (8) Except as provided in subsection (9) of this section, the first demand shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State not later than the 42nd day and a supplemental demand not later than the 52nd day after the date of the election in which votes were cast for the nomination, office or measure. (9) A demand for a recount made under this section on behalf of the electors of presidential and vice presidential candidates shall be for a full recount only and shall be filed no later than five business days after the Secretary of State declares the result of the election under ORS 254.555.",
