(3) After an election on formation is held, if both the formation of the district and the division of the district into zones are approved by the voters, the order issued under ORS 198.820 (3) creating the district shall declare that the district contains zones with the boundaries specified in the petition or order for formation. If only formation of the district is approved by the voters, the order creating the district shall be issued as provided in ORS 198.820. (4) If the district is formed without an election, the order issued under ORS 198.820 (3) creating the district shall declare that the district contains zones with the boundaries specified in the petition or order for formation. (5) When a district containing zones is formed under this section, the first board of directors of the district, prior to the levy of any ad valorem taxes by the district, shall provide notice of a public hearing and conduct the hearing as provided in ORS 478.480 (2) and 478.485. After the public hearing required under this section, the board shall enter an order in its journal stating the percentage of the total amount of ad valorem taxes of the district that will be collected in each zone. The board may then determine, make and declare the ad valorem tax levy for each zone. (6) The boundaries of the zones and the percentages of taxes collected in each zone that are established for a district under this section shall be effective until the regular district election in the first odd-numbered year following the year in which the district is formed. At that regular district election, a proposal for changing the boundaries of the zones may be submitted to the voters of the district as provided in ORS 478.480 (2), 478.485 and 478.490. If no proposal for a boundary change is submitted, the boundaries of the zones established upon formation of the district shall be retained until notice of a change is given to, and approved by, the voters of the district as provided in ORS",

(b) Whether the method established in a district for nominating and electing directors should be changed to another method. (2) A question under this section shall be decided by election. The district board shall order an election when a petition is filed as provided in this section. (3) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the requirements for preparing, circulating and filing a petition under this section shall be as provided for an initiative petition in ORS 255.135 to 255.205. (4) If the question proposes creation of subdistricts or a change in the boundaries or the number of existing subdistricts, the following requirements shall apply: (a) The petition shall contain a map indicating the proposed subdistrict boundaries. The map shall be attached to the cover sheet of the petition and shall not exceed 14 inches by 17 inches in size. (b) Notwithstanding ORS 250.035, the statement summarizing the measure and its major effect in the ballot title shall not exceed 150 words. (c) The following apply to the statement summarizing the measure and its major effect in the ballot title: (A) The statement shall specify the method of nomination and election of directors from among the methods described in ORS 478.221. (B) The statement shall specify whether, in filling each position on the board, an elector of the district may sign a petition of nomination or vote for a candidate from any subdistrict or only for a candidate from the subdistrict in which the elector resides. (C) If the method for nominating directors combines nomination of candidates from and by subdistricts and nomination of candidates at large, the statement shall specify the number of candidates to be nominated in each manner. The statement shall include a general description of the proposed boundaries of the subdistricts, using streets and other generally recognized features. (d) The order calling the election shall contain a map of the proposed subdistrict boundaries and a metes and bounds or legal description of the proposed subdistrict boundaries. The map and description shall be prepared by the county surveyor or county assessor and shall reflect any adjustment made in the boundaries under subsection (7) of this section. (5) The map to be contained in the petition under subsection (4) of this section shall be prepared by the county surveyor or county assessor. The chief petitioners shall pay the county for the cost of preparing the map, as determined by the county surveyor or county assessor. The county clerk shall not accept the prospective petition for filing until the chief petitioners have paid the amount due.

(7) If the district board determines or adjusts the boundaries of the subdistricts under ORS 478.228 before submitting the question under this section, the district board shall amend the ballot title as necessary to reflect its adjustment of the boundaries. (8) If the electors of the district approve the creation of subdistricts, or a change in the boundaries or the number of existing subdistricts, directors then holding office shall continue to serve until their terms of office expire. As vacancies occur, positions to be filled by nomination or election by subdistrict shall be filled by persons who reside within subdistricts which are not represented on the board.

(b) Coverage area means an area established by a district pursuant to this section that consists of the following: (A) Lands that are included in the district; and (B) Some or all of the lands that are within seven road miles of a fire station in the district and are not included in any other district. (c) Fire station means a fire station recognized by a fire insurance rating organization as a fire station that is equipped and has personnel who respond to calls. (d) Road means any public or private thoroughfare that may be used for vehicular traffic. (2) A district may establish the coverage area of the district one or more times, subject to the requirements of subsection (3) of this section. (3)(a) If a district intends to establish a coverage area that includes lands that are within seven road miles of a fire station in any other district: (A) Before establishing the coverage area, the district intending to include the lands must send notice to the other district or districts. (B) The notified district or districts must: (i) Reply not more than 90 days after the notice described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is sent; and (ii) State whether the notified district or districts intend to include the lands in the coverage area or areas of the notified district or districts. (b) If the district that provided notice under paragraph (a)(A) of this subsection does not receive a reply or replies within 90 days, as described in paragraph (a)(B) of this subsection, or receives a reply or replies within 90 days indicating that the notified district or districts do not intend to include the lands, the district that provided the notice may include the lands. (c) If the district that provided notice under paragraph (a)(A) of this subsection receives a reply or replies within 90 days, as described in paragraph (a)(B) of this subsection, that states that the other district or districts also intend to include the lands, the districts shall all: (A) Negotiate in good faith to determine which district will include the lands; and (B) Attempt to reach a resolution not more than 90 days after the reply, or after the latest multiple replies, described in paragraph (a)(B) of this subsection is sent. (d) If districts do not reach a resolution described in paragraph (c) of this subsection within 90 days after the reply, or after the latest of multiple replies, described in paragraph (a)(B) of this subsection is sent, the district in which the fire station that is closest to the lands is located shall include the lands. (4) If a district establishes the coverage area of the district, after any applicable requirements in subsection (3) of this section are met, the district shall send notice to any owners of lands within the coverage area that are not included in a district that: (a) Within 90 days after the notice is sent, the owners may consent to add the lands of the owners to the district as described in ORS 478.140 at no cost for adding the lands; and (b) After sending the notice and before consent from the owners is received, or more than 90 days after sending the notice if the district does not receive consent from the owners as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection within the 90 days, the district may decide not to protect the owners lands and, if the district provides services at the lands, may bill the owners at three times the cost of the services, as determined based on a state standardized-costs schedule approved by the State Fire Marshal. (5) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law: (a) A district or county may not charge a fee for adding lands to a district under subsection (4) of this section, including a fee for filing paperwork related to adding the lands. (b) A person or a public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, may not bring an action against a district for declining to protect the lands of owners that do not consent to add the lands of the owners to the district under subsection (4) of this section. (6)(a) If a district bills an owner as described in subsection (4)(b) of this section and the owner does not pay the bill within 60 days, the district may secure payment of the claim by filing an itemized and sworn statement, setting forth the dates of performance and the nature of the services performed, with the county clerk of the county in which the services were rendered. (b) The claim shall constitute a valid lien against the interest of the owner that may be established and enforced in the same manner as provided by law for the enforcement of mechanics liens. (c) The county may not charge a fee related to the claim, including a fee related to filing or processing the claim. (7) A person that insures lands within the coverage area of a district: (a) Shall confirm with the district whether the lands are included in the district. (b) May not provide an insurance discount if the lands are not included in the district. (8) If a district identifies the coverage area of the district, subject to the provisions of ORS 478.010, the board of directors of the district shall annex to the district any lands that are within the coverage area of the district, but are not included in the district, when: (a) Ownership of the lands transfers; (b) A new structure subject to damage by fire is built on the lands; (c) A building permit that relates to the lands is issued; or (d) A land use decision, as defined in ORS 197.015, a limited land use decision, as defined in ORS 197.015, or a decision concerning a partition, as defined in ORS 92.010, or a subdivision, as defined in ORS 92.010, that relates to the lands is approved or issued. (9) A person that owns lands within a coverage area of the district that are not included in the district shall: (a) Send notice to the county if an event described in subsection (8) of this section occurs, unless documentation of the event is otherwise filed with the county; and (b) Ensure that any information in documentation or a notice that relates to the lands and is provided to the county is accurate. (10) If a county receives notice of, receives documentation of or otherwise becomes aware of the occurrence of an event described in subsection (8) of this section on lands in a coverage area of the district, the county shall send notice to the board of directors of the district that the event has occurred. (11) After the board of directors receives notice from a county as described in subsection (10) of this section or otherwise becomes aware that an event described in subsection (8) of this section has occurred, if the board of directors confirms that the lands are in the coverage area of the district, the board of directors shall annex the lands and, upon annexing the lands, shall: (a) Issue an order of annexation of the lands that includes an attestation that an event described in subsection (8) of this section has occurred; (b) File duplicate copies of the order with the Department of Revenue, the Secretary of State and the county clerk and county assessor of each county in which the district is located; (c) File a legal description of the change or proposed change and an accurate map showing the change or proposed change, as described in ORS 308.225; and (d) Take the steps necessary to ensure that the lands are added to the assessment roll for the tax year beginning July 1 following the calendar year in which the lands are annexed. (12) If a board of directors files a legal description and map consistent with ORS 308.225, the county assessor and the department shall act in accordance with ORS 308.225. (13) The provisions of ORS 198.705 to 198.955, 478.115 and 478.150 do not apply to an annexation under this section. (14) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, an annexation under this section is not subject to an election. (15) Notwithstanding subsection (13) of this section, an annexation or other addition of lands under this section has the effects described in ORS 198.860. (16) Lands annexed or otherwise added under this section may be subject to tax assessment by the district as described in this chapter and a fee described in ORS",

A deputy of a fire chief has the power to perform any act or duty of the fire chief under this section. (2) The fire chief shall prescribe conditions upon which permission is granted and which are necessary to be observed in setting the fire and preventing it from spreading and endangering life or property or endangering the air resources of this state. The Environmental Quality Commission shall notify the State Fire Marshal of the type of and time for burning to be allowed on each day under schedules adopted pursuant to ORS 468A.570 and ORS 468A.595. The State Fire Marshal shall cause all fire chiefs and their deputies in the affected area to be notified of the type and time for burning to be allowed on each day with updating messages each day as required. A fire chief or deputy shall grant permission only in accordance with the schedule of the Environmental Quality Commission but may reduce hours to be allowed for burning if necessary to prevent danger to life or property from fire. The State Fire Marshal may refuse, revoke or postpone permission when necessary in the judgment of the State Fire Marshal to prevent danger to life or property from fire, notwithstanding any determination by the fire chief. (3) Nothing in this section relieves a person starting a fire from responsibility for providing adequate protection to prevent injury or damage to the person or property of another. If such burning results in the escape of fire and injury or damage to the person or property of another, such escape and damage or injury constitutes prima facie evidence that the burning was not safe. (4) Within a district, no person shall, during the fire season declared under ORS 477.505, operate any equipment in forest harvesting or agricultural operations powered by an internal combustion engine on or within one-eighth of one mile of forestland unless each piece of equipment is provided with a fire extinguisher of sufficient size and capacity and with such other tools and fire-fighting equipment as may be reasonably required by the fire chief of the district. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to machinery regulated by ORS chapter 477. (5) No person shall dispose of any building or building wreckage within a district by fire without having first secured permission therefor from the fire chief. No person shall refuse to comply with any reasonable requirements of the fire chief as to the safeguarding of such fire from spreading. (6) This section is not intended to limit the authority of a district to adopt a fire prevention code as provided in ORS 478.910 to 478.940 or to issue permits when the burning is done by mechanical burners fired by liquefied petroleum gas. (7) The fire chief shall maintain records of all permits and the conditions thereof, if any, that are issued for field burning under this section and shall submit at such times, as the Environmental Quality Commission shall require such records or summaries thereof to the commission. The Environmental Quality Commission shall provide forms for the reports required under this subsection. (8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section: (a) A permit is required for field burning authorized pursuant to ORS 468A.550 to 468A.620 and 468A.992. (b) For a permit for the propane flaming of mint stubble, the fire chief may only prescribe conditions necessary to prevent the spread of fire or to prevent endangering life or property and may refuse, revoke or postpone permission to conduct the propane flaming only when necessary to prevent danger to life or property from fire.",
