(1)(a) Before any person or other legal entity pays or delivers the proceeds of a compensable crime to any individual charged with or convicted of committing such a crime in this state or found guilty except for insanity with regard to such a crime, or to a representative or assignee of that individual, the person or legal entity shall promptly notify the Department of Justice and pay or deliver to the department the proceeds that would otherwise be paid to the individual charged, convicted or found guilty except for insanity, or the representative or assignee of the individual. (b) When any person or other legal entity contracts to pay the proceeds of the compensable crime to any individual charged with or convicted of committing such a crime in this state or found guilty except for insanity with regard to such a crime, or whenever any person or other legal entity contracts with a representative or assignee of that individual to pay the proceeds of the compensable crime committed by that individual, the person or legal entity shall promptly submit a copy of the contract to the Department of Justice and pay to the department any proceeds which otherwise, under the terms of the contract, would be paid to the accused or convicted individual, the person found guilty except for insanity or the representative or assignee of the individual. (2) The department shall deposit proceeds received under this section in an escrow account established for the benefit of the victims or dependents of the victims of the crime for which the individual whose proceeds are placed in the escrow account is convicted or found guilty except for insanity. Proceeds in the escrow account shall be paid to satisfy judgments as provided in subsection (3) of this section or restitution orders under ORS 137.103 to 137.109. (3) A person is entitled to payment of proceeds from the escrow account established under this section if: (a) The person is the victim or a dependent of a deceased victim of a compensable crime for which the individual whose proceeds are placed in the escrow account is convicted or found guilty except for insanity; and (b) Within five years after the establishment of the escrow account, the person commences a civil action against such individual in a court of competent jurisdiction and receives a money judgment for damages suffered as a result of the crime. (4) The department, at least once every year for five years from the date it establishes the escrow account, shall cause to have published a legal notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the crime was committed and in the counties adjoining such county advising victims that the escrow proceeds are available to satisfy judgments pursuant to this section. The department may, in its discretion, provide for such additional notice as it considers necessary. (5) Upon dismissal of charges or acquittal of any individual whose proceeds are placed in an escrow account under this section, the department shall immediately pay such individual the proceeds in the escrow account. (6) Upon a showing by any convicted individual or the individual found guilty except for insanity that five years have elapsed from the establishment of the escrow account in which the individuals proceeds have been placed under this section and that no civil actions by victims or dependents of deceased victims of the individuals crime have been commenced, the department shall immediately pay any proceeds in the escrow account to such individual or the legal representative of the individual. (7) Any action taken by an individual charged with or convicted of committing a compensable crime in this state, including, but not limited to, execution of a power of attorney or creation of a corporate entity, to defeat the purpose of this section is null and void. Any action taken by an individual found guilty except for insanity with regard to a compensable crime in this state is similarly null and void. (8) When an escrow account has insufficient funds to meet all judgments presented by victims or their representatives, the escrow account shall be prorated among the victims or their representatives on the basis of the amounts of the unsatisfied judgments or partially satisfied judgments. There shall be no payment from the escrow account to a victim or a victims representative until either the amounts of all unsatisfied judgments are determined, or it is determined that the payment for an unsatisfied judgment will not diminish the escrow account so that other potential victim claims could not be satisfied. (9)(a) The Department of Justice may notify any person whom the department believes to be in possession of the proceeds of a compensable crime, or to have contracted to pay the proceeds of a compensable crime as described in subsection (1) of this section, of the requirements of this section. (b) Any person who disputes whether that person either possesses or has contracted to pay the proceeds of a compensable crime may ask for a contested case hearing on the question before the department. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of ORS chapter 183. (10) Notwithstanding subsection (9) of this section, the Department of Justice may seek provisional remedies, including garnishment or injunctive relief, to prevent the payment of money or property which the department asserts to be the proceeds of a compensable crime to an individual charged with or convicted of committing such a crime in this state or found guilty except for insanity with regard to such a crime, or to the representative or assignee of that individual, until the character of the property or money is determined. (11) The Department of Justice may adopt rules to carry out the purposes of this section. (12) As used in this section, proceeds of a compensable crime means any property or assets, tangible or intangible: (a) That are obtained during the commission of the compensable crime; or (b) That are obtained after commission of the crime primarily because of commission of the compensable crime. (13) As used in this section, proceeds of a compensable crime does not include property or assets that have been forfeited pursuant to law or that constitute contraband. It also does not include property or assets in which the individual charged or convicted of committing a compensable crime has no legal or equitable interest.",

(1) Subject to the availability of funds from gifts, grants and donations in the Sexual Assault Victims Emergency Medical Response Fund, the Department of Justice shall pay the costs of: (a) A complete medical assessment obtained by the victim of a sexual assault if the victim obtains the medical assessment no later than 84 hours after the sexual assault. (b) A partial medical assessment obtained by the victim of a sexual assault if the victim obtains the medical assessment no later than seven days after the sexual assault. (2) The department may not deny payment under this section for any of the following reasons: (a) The victim of a sexual assault has not reported the assault to a law enforcement agency. (b) The identity of a victim of a sexual assault is not readily available to the department because forensic evidence has been collected from the victim and preserved in a manner intended to protect the victims identity. (3) The department shall develop a form that the victim of a sexual assault must complete if the victim wants the department to pay for a medical assessment as provided in subsection (1) of this section. The department shall make copies of the form available to providers of medical assessments. The form must inform the victim that: (a) A complete or partial medical assessment can be obtained regardless of whether the victim reports the assault to a law enforcement agency; and (b) A complete or partial medical assessment can be performed and evidence collected in a manner intended to protect the victims identity. (4) When the victim of a sexual assault completes the form developed by the department under subsection (3) of this section, the victim shall submit the form to the provider of the medical assessment. The provider shall submit the form with a bill for the medical assessment to the department. A provider who submits a bill under this subsection may not bill the victim or the victims insurance carrier for the medical assessment except to the extent that the department is unable to pay the bill due to lack of funds or declines to pay the bill. (5) Providers of medical assessments that seek reimbursement under this section shall: (a) Maintain records of medical assessments that protect the identity of victims of sexual assault and keep confidential the identity of victims who have not reported the sexual assault to a law enforcement agency; (b) Store sexual assault forensic evidence kits and transfer custody of the kits to a law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the geographic area where the provider is located; and (c) Cooperate with law enforcement agencies to develop and implement procedures that protect the identities of victims while allowing retrieval and assessment of sexual assault forensic evidence kits and related evidence. (6) Law enforcement agencies that receive evidence as provided by subsection (5) of this section shall preserve: (a) A sexual assault forensic evidence kit for no less than 60 years after collection of the evidence; and (b) Any related evidence for at least six months. (7) A provider may not charge the department more for a complete medical assessment or a partial medical assessment than the maximum amounts established by the department by rule for the assessments. (8) The victim of a sexual assault may obtain a medical assessment and complete and submit a form under this section regardless of whether the victim reports the sexual assault to a law enforcement agency. (9) This section does not require the department to pay any costs of treatment for injuries resulting from the sexual assault. (10) The department shall create, and make available to medical assessment providers, informational materials describing the services payable by the fund as described in subsection (1) of this section. A provider shall ensure that the informational materials are made available to sexual assault victims. (11) The department may adopt rules necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.

(B) The court shall review the response and affidavit in camera.

      "text": "Appellate review as matter of right; notice of interlocutory appeal; service; response. (1) Appellate review of an order described in ORS 147.535 (4)(a) must be initiated by filing a notice of interlocutory appeal with the Supreme Court substantially in the form prescribed by rule of the Supreme Court. Review of the order is a matter of right. (2) The person or party filing the notice of interlocutory appeal shall be identified as the appellant and the defendant shall be identified as the respondent. Any other person described in subsection (6)(a) to (f) of this section who is a party to the appeal shall be identified as a respondent. (3) The notice of interlocutory appeal must contain: (a) A designation of those portions of the trial court record, including oral proceedings, to be included in the record on appeal; and (b) A statement of why the notice is timely. (4) The appellant shall include with the notice of interlocutory appeal the following materials: (a) A copy of the order for which appellate review is sought, which must be attached to the notice. (b) Excerpts of the record necessary to determine the question presented and the relief sought. An excerpt of record must include a copy of the form described in ORS 147.515 (2)(a), if the form was completed and provided to the trial court. (c) A memorandum of law containing: (A) A concise but complete statement of facts material to a determination of the question presented and the relief sought; and (B) Supporting arguments and citations of authority. (5) The Supreme Court may: (a) Direct a party to the appeal to supplement the record with a copy of additional parts of the record or a transcript of the parts of the oral proceedings in the trial court necessary to determine the question presented and the relief sought; or (b) Direct the trial court administrator to forward all or part of the trial court record. (6) The appellant shall serve a copy of the notice of interlocutory appeal and the accompanying materials described in subsection (4) of this section on the following other persons: (a) The victim who asserted the claim that resulted in the order being appealed and any victim who asserted a related claim; (b) Any person who filed a response under ORS 147.517 (4) to the claim that resulted in the order being appealed or a related claim; (c) Any person who filed the motion that resulted in the order being appealed or a related motion under ORS 147.522; (d) Any person against whom relief was sought in the hearing that resulted in the order being appealed or a related hearing under ORS 147.530; (e) The prosecuting attorney; (f) The Attorney General; (g) The defendant; and (h) The Oregon Public Defense Commission, if the defendant is represented by appointed counsel. (7) The appellant shall serve a copy of the notice of interlocutory appeal on: (a) The trial court administrator; and (b) The trial court transcript coordinator, if the notice of interlocutory appeal contains a designation of the oral proceedings before the trial court as part of the record on appeal. (8)(a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the appellant shall serve and file the notice of interlocutory appeal and, if applicable, the accompanying materials described in subsection (4) of this section within seven days after the date the trial court entered the order being appealed. (b) An appellant who seeks to appeal an order issued under ORS 147.530 and who was not provided with a copy of the order as required by ORS 147.530 (6) may serve and file the notice of interlocutory appeal and, if applicable, the accompanying materials described in subsection (4) of this section within seven days after the date of receiving a copy of the order. (c) The appellant shall serve the prosecuting attorney and the Attorney General so that the copy of the notice of interlocutory appeal and accompanying materials are received on the same day the notice is filed with the Supreme Court. (d) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, the appellant shall serve all persons described in subsections (6) and (7) of this section so that the copy of the notice of interlocutory appeal and, if applicable, accompanying materials are received no later than one judicial day after the notice is filed. (9) Within three days after receipt of a notice of interlocutory appeal that contains a designation of record under subsection (3) of this section, the trial court administrator shall forward to the Supreme Court an audio record of the designated oral proceedings. (10) If the Supreme Court directs a party to provide a transcript of oral proceedings under subsection (5) of this section, the party shall provide the transcript to the Supreme Court within seven days after the date of the Supreme Courts order. (11)(a) The following requirements are jurisdictional and may not be waived or extended: (A) The timely filing of the original notice of interlocutory appeal and accompanying materials described in subsection (4) of this section with the Supreme Court; and (B) The service of the notice of interlocutory appeal within the time limits described in subsection (8) of this section on all persons identified in subsection (6) of this section. (b) Failure to timely serve a true and complete copy of the accompanying materials described in subsection (4) of this section is not jurisdictional, provided that the appellant made a good faith effort to do so and substantially complied with those requirements. (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this subsection, the Supreme Court may dismiss the appeal as to any respondent if the appellant, after receipt of a notice of noncompliance, does not promptly cure a deficiency in the materials or if the failure to timely serve a true and complete copy of the accompanying materials substantially prejudices the respondents ability to respond to the appeal. (12) A respondent may file a response, which must be filed within seven days after the date the notice of interlocutory appeal is filed with the Supreme Court. (13)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the appellant may not file a reply. (b) If the Supreme Court determines that the case is unusually complex, due to the number of persons involved or the existence of novel questions of law, and the court would benefit from additional briefing, the court may extend the briefing schedule described in this section and allow the appellant to file a reply. (14) The appellant or respondent may request oral argument. The Supreme Court may grant or deny a request for oral argument or order oral argument on its own motion. (15) At any time after submission of the appellants memorandum of law, the Supreme Court, on its own motion or on the motion of the respondent, may summarily affirm the trial courts order, with or without the submission of a response or oral argument, if the Supreme Court determines that the appeal does not present a substantial question of law. A motion for summary affirmance has no effect on the timelines described in this section. (16)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the Supreme Court shall issue its decision on appeal under this section within 21 days after the date the notice of interlocutory appeal is filed. (b) The Supreme Court may issue a final decision beyond the 21-day period if the court determines that the ends of justice served by issuing a final decision at a later date outweigh the best interests of the victim, the prosecuting attorney, the defendant, any person against whom relief was ordered and the public. (c) In making the determination under paragraph (b) of this subsection, the Supreme Court shall consider: (A) Whether the case is unusually complex, due to the number of persons involved or the existence of novel questions of law, and whether 21 days is an unreasonable amount of time for the court to issue a decision; and (B) Whether the failure to extend the 21-day period would be likely to result in a miscarriage of justice. (17) Appellate review under this section is confined to the record. The Supreme Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court as to any issue of fact and shall review challenges to a factual finding for evidence in the record to support the finding. The Supreme Court shall review for errors of law and, when the law delegates discretion to the trial court, determine whether the trial courts exercise of discretion was outside the range of discretion delegated to the trial court. (18) The Supreme Court may affirm, modify, reverse or remand the trial courts order. The court may reverse or remand the order only if it finds that the order is unlawful in substance or procedure and that the substantial rights of the appellant were prejudiced as a result. (19) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a notice of interlocutory appeal and the response described in subsection (12) of this section are filed under this section when those documents are physically received by the Supreme Court or, if the documents are filed electronically, as provided by rule of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. (20) In addition to any other method authorized by law, service under this section may be accomplished by electronic mail or facsimile transmission, in a manner consistent with any applicable rules of appellate procedure.

(5)(a) A certifying official processing a certification under this section shall: (A) Fully complete and sign the certification form; and (B) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, include in the form specific details about the nature of the qualifying criminal activity investigated or prosecuted and a detailed description of the victims helpfulness or likely helpfulness.

(d) A certification agency shall keep a copy of a denial notification for at least three years from the date of the notification. (e) A decision by a certifying agency to deny certification under this section is not appealable under ORS chapter 19.
