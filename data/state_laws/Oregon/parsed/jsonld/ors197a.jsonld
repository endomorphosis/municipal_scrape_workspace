As used in ORS 197.475 to 197.493 and ORS chapter 197A: (1) Allocated housing need means the housing need allocated to a city under ORS 184.453 (2) as segmented by income level under ORS 184.453 (4). (2) Buildable lands means lands in urban and urbanizable areas that are suitable, available and necessary for the development of needed housing over a 20-year planning period, including both vacant land and developed land likely to be redeveloped. (3) City and city with a population of 10,000 or greater includes, regardless of size, any city within Tillamook County and the communities of Barview/Twin Rocks/Watseco, Cloverdale, Hebo, Neahkahnie, Neskowin, Netarts, Oceanside and Pacific City/Woods. (4) Development-ready lands means buildable lands that are likely to support the production of housing during the period of their housing production target under ORS 184.455 (1) because the lands are: (a) Currently annexed and zoned to allow housing through clear and objective standards and procedures; (b) Readily served through adjacent public facilities or identified for the near-term provision of public facilities through an adopted capital improvement plan; and (c) Not encumbered by any applicable local, state or federal protective regulations or have appropriate entitlements to prepare the land for development. (5) Government assisted housing means housing that is financed in whole or part by either a federal or state housing agency or a housing authority as defined in ORS 456.005, or housing that is occupied by a tenant or tenants who benefit from rent supplements or housing vouchers provided by either a federal or state housing agency or a local housing authority. (6) Housing capacity means the number of needed housing units that can be developed on buildable lands within the 20-year planning period based on the lands comprehensive plan designation and capacity for housing development and redevelopment. (7) Housing production strategy means a strategy adopted by a local government to promote housing production under ORS 197A.100. (8) Manufactured dwelling, manufactured dwelling park, manufactured home and mobile home park have the meanings given those terms in ORS 446.003.

(2)(a) In determining whether a city should be referred under subsection (3) of this section, the department may base its evaluation on the citys relative performance with consideration of its region, as established in the Oregon Housing Needs Analysis under ORS 184.451 (1), on any one of, or any combination of, the following: (A) A citys progress, proportionate to its population size, toward the total housing production target under ORS 184.455 (2)(a). (B) A citys progress, proportionate to its population size, toward the housing production targets for those affordability levels for families making less than 80 percent of median family income under ORS 184.455 (2)(b). (C) The citys performance as demonstrated by a statewide housing equity indicator under ORS 456.602. (b) The department may not base a determination made under this subsection solely on a citys performance on any single equity indicator. (3) Each year, the department shall refer into its housing acceleration program, under subsection (4) of this section: (a) Of those cities that adopted a housing production strategy more than three but less than four years ago, including as required by subsection (7)(a) of this section, the lowest performing cities, if any exist, as determined under subsection (2) of this section; (b) Each city that has failed to adopt a housing production strategy by the deadline under ORS 197A.100 (1); (c) Each city that has failed to undertake actions in its housing production strategy by the deadline under ORS 197A.100 (4); and (d) Cities referred under ORS 197.319 (4). (4) For each city referred to the housing acceleration program, within six months, the department shall, in cooperation with the city, complete an audit of specific housing barriers, that must include an analysis of the following factors affecting housing production, affordability and choice: (a) The existing housing production strategy and the documents and record supporting the strategy; (b) Public written comments and invited stakeholder feedback received by a date specified by the department; (c) Land use planning regulations, including zoning and development code; (d) Permitting and approval processes relating to development of housing and infrastructure supporting housing; (e) Required fees, exactions and improvements; (f) Actions and inactions that can impact fair and equitable housing outcomes, environmental justice, climate resilience and location choice; (g) Local resource deficiencies, including staffing, public facilities, capital improvements to infrastructure, availability of buildable lands and actions or investments to prepare land for development; (h) Specific additional state resources that could support housing production; (i) Changes to state laws or rules or the regulations, policies, actions or inactions of any public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, as that could impact housing production; and (j) Other factors limiting housing that are not within the citys control. (5) In performing an audit under subsection (4) of this section, the department: (a) May request concurrent review of the citys measures and housing production strategies under ORS 197A.205; and (b) Shall notify any public body identified under subsection (4)(i) of this section. (6) Within six months following an audit under subsection (4) of this section, the city and the department must enter into a housing acceleration agreement that is based on and proportionate to the citys basis for referral under subsection (3) of this section and informed by the audit under subsection (4) of this section. (7) Under the housing acceleration agreement, the department shall agree to provide: (a) Specified technical assistance, regulatory support and other assistance, to assist the city in performing its agreement under subsection (8) of this section; (b) Specific funding under the departments control; and (c) Specified assistance in pursuing other state or public funds. (8) Under the housing acceleration agreement, the city shall agree to: (a) If the department determines that the factors affecting housing production, affordability and choice are a consequence of policies and practices that are directly within the citys control, adopt an amended housing production strategy within six months that includes: (A) A timeline for performance under ORS 197A.100 (4) of no less than one year; and (B) Specified actions which may include, but are not limited to: (i) Actions under ORS 197A.100 (3); (ii) Dedicating funds for increased local capacity to facilitate housing production, affordability and choice; (iii) Dedicating funds for public facilities and infrastructure necessary to support housing production; (iv) Taking measures that increase the availability of development-ready land; (v) Amending the development code, approval criteria or procedures to reduce cost or delay to housing production; and (vi) Taking emergency temporary measures to support housing production; and (b) Join any department initiated interagency mediation to identify policies and resources that would support housing production in the city. (9) The department may require that a city that is not required to adopt an amendment to its housing production strategy under subsection (8)(a) of this section include findings at the time that the city is next required to adopt a housing production strategy under ORS 197A.100 (1) that describe how the city has addressed the audits findings and any suggested actions. (10) The department may grant limited extensions to deadlines under subsections (3)(b) and (c) and (8)(a) of this section for emergencies, good cause or other factors outside of the citys control. (11) The actions by a city or department under this section are not land use decisions and are not subject to appeal or review. (12) All public bodies, as defined in ORS 174.109, are directed to assist cities and the department in the performance of their duties under this section and to take timely action to ensure that the agencys rules or policies do not unduly delay implementation of a housing acceleration agreement under this section.

      "text": "Local government planning for needed housing. (1) The availability of affordable, decent, safe and sanitary housing opportunities for persons of lower, middle and fixed income, including agriculture workforce housing, is a matter of statewide concern. (2) Many persons of lower, middle and fixed income depend on government assisted housing as a source of affordable, decent, safe and sanitary housing. (3) A local government shall permit needed housing in one or more zoning districts or in zones described by some comprehensive plans as overlay zones with sufficient buildable land to satisfy that need. [Formerly subsections (1) to (3) of 197.307] (Temporary provisions relating to affordable housing pilot program) Note: Sections 1 to 9, chapter 52, Oregon Laws 2016, provide: Sec. 1. Sections 2 to 9 of this 2016 Act are added to and made a part of ORS 197.295 to 197.314 [series became ORS chapter 197A]. [2016 c.52 1] Sec. 2. Legislative findings. The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that a supply of land dedicated to affordable housing, planned and zoned to encourage development of affordable housing and protected for affordable housing siting over a long period, is necessary for the economic prosperity of communities in this state. [2016 c.52 2] Sec. 3. Affordable housing pilot program. The Land Conservation and Development Commission, working with the Housing and Community Services Department, other state agencies and local governments, shall establish and implement an affordable housing pilot program. Notwithstanding any statewide land use planning goal provisions specifying requirements for amending urban growth boundaries, the commission shall adopt rules to implement the pilot program on or before July 1, 2017. The pilot program is intended to: (1) Encourage local governments to provide an adequate supply of land within urban growth boundaries that is dedicated to affordable housing; (2) Encourage the development of affordable housing on land dedicated to affordable housing; and (3) Protect land dedicated to affordable housing from conversion to other uses before or after the development of affordable housing. [2016 c.52 3] Sec. 4. Establishment of site selection process. (1) Under the rules adopted under section 3, chapter 52, Oregon Laws 2016, the Land Conservation and Development Commission shall establish a site selection process by which the commission shall select two pilot projects, one from a city with a population of 25,000 or less and one from a city with a population greater than 25,000, from among nominations made by local governments. However, if the commission has not received any qualifying nominations from a city with a population of 25,000 or less on or before January 1, 2020, the commission may select any two pilot projects eligible for selection on or before August 17, 2018. (2) A local government may nominate a pilot project that provides a site dedicated to affordable housing within the jurisdiction of the local government. (3) When nominating a pilot project for the site selection process, a local government shall: (a) Submit a concept plan for the pilot project, including any proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan and land use regulations required to implement the pilot project; and (b) Demonstrate that the landowner of the site has agreed to designation of the landowners property as a pilot project for the purposes of sections 2 to 9, chapter 52, Oregon Laws 2016. (4) The commission shall select pilot projects that are: (a) Reasonably likely to provide a site for affordable housing that would not otherwise be provided without the special provisions of the pilot program; (b) Reasonably likely to serve identified populations in the area that require affordable housing; (c) Adjacent to the citys existing urban growth boundary; (d) Near public facilities and services, including roadways and an identified transit corridor to serve the area, or for which public facilities and services are planned and reasonably likely to be provided at a reasonable cost in the near future; (e) Located, planned and zoned to avoid or minimize adverse effects on natural resources and nearby farm and forest uses if the pilot project would require amending an urban growth boundary to include the pilot project site; and (f) Nominated by a local government that demonstrates efforts by the local government to accommodate and encourage the development of needed housing within its existing urban growth boundary. (5) The following local governments are not eligible for nomination or selection under the pilot program: (a) Clackamas, Marion, Multnomah, Polk and Washington Counties and cities within Clackamas, Marion, Multnomah, Polk and Washington Counties; (b) Metro and cities and counties included in the Metro urban growth boundary; and (c) Local governments within Jefferson County that are served by the North Unit Irrigation District. (6) In addition to the pilot projects selected by the commission under subsection (1) of this section, the commission may select a nominated pilot project that: (a) Is submitted by the City of Pendleton; and (b) Complies with the requirements of subsections (3) and (4) of this section. [2016 c.52 4; 2019 c.32 1; 2021 c.112 1; 2023 c.221 1] Sec. 5. Rules. (1) The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall, by rule: (a) Define affordable housing; (b) Specify types of affordable housing allowed on pilot project sites, including sites that are used as manufactured dwelling parks; (c) Limit the total acreage of all lots and parcels included in each pilot project site to not greater than 50 acres; and (d) Specify local government efforts that serve to demonstrate that the local government is accommodating and encouraging development of needed housing within its existing urban growth boundary. (2) The commission shall specify by rule related requirements for affordable housing that may include a sales price or rental rate range, taking into consideration: (a) Housing prices within the region compared to the income of residents of that region; (b) The availability of government assisted housing in the region; (c) The need for sites to accommodate manufactured dwellings, as defined in ORS 446.003, due to the conversion of manufactured dwelling parks or mobile home parks in the region to other uses; and (d) Other relevant factors as identified by the commission. (3) The commission may adopt rules that authorize mixed income housing developments that include affordable housing on pilot project sites. [2016 c.52 5] Sec. 6. Expedited process for amending urban growth boundaries to include selected site. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 197A.320 [renumbered 197A.285] and without regard to whether an urban growth boundary already contains a 20-year supply of buildable lands, the Land Conservation and Development Commission by rule may establish an expedited process for amending urban growth boundaries to include pilot project sites selected under section 4 of this 2016 Act. (2) An amendment to an urban growth boundary pursuant to this section must identify the specific goal and rule requirements related to urban growth boundaries from which a local government is exempt for the purpose of implementing the pilot program. (3) Pilot project sites included within an urban growth boundary amended pursuant to this section must: (a) Be dedicated to affordable housing; and (b) Remain planned and zoned for affordable housing, except as otherwise provided in rules adopted pursuant to section 5 (3) of this 2016 Act. [2016 c.52 6] Sec. 7. Site protection from conversion to other uses. (1) The local government of a pilot project site selected by the Land Conservation and Development Commission under section 4 of this 2016 Act shall protect the pilot project site within its urban growth boundary from conversion to other uses before, during and after the development of affordable housing at the pilot project site, except as provided otherwise in rules adopted by the commission under section 5 (3) of this 2016 Act. (2) The local government of a pilot project site selected by the commission shall ensure that housing developed on the site continues to be used to provide affordable housing for a period of at least 50 years after the selection of the pilot project site through: (a) Zoning restrictions; (b) Guaranteed rental rates or sales prices; (c) Incentives, contract commitments, density bonuses or other voluntary regulations, provisions or conditions designed to increase the supply of moderate or lower cost housing units; (d) Other regulations, provisions or conditions determined by the local government to be effective in maintaining the affordability of housing on land selected for a pilot project under section 4 of this 2016 Act; or (e) Restrictive agreements entered into with sources of affordable housing funding. (3) The local government of a pilot project site selected by the commission may authorize a mix of affordable housing and other housing types on the site, provided that the percentage of affordable housing units developed on the site meets or exceeds requirements specified in rules adopted by the commission pursuant to section 5 (3) of this 2016 Act. [2016 c.52 7] Sec. 8. Certain local government actions prohibited. (1) The local government of a pilot project site selected by the Land Conservation and Development Commission under section 4 of this 2016 Act may not plan or zone the site to allow a use or mix of uses not authorized under sections 2 to 9 of this 2016 Act unless the local government withdraws the pilot project site from the urban growth boundary and rezones the site pursuant to law, statewide land use planning goals and land use regulations implementing the goals that regulate allowable uses of land outside urban growth boundaries. (2) A local government may not use sections 2 to 9 of this 2016 Act to bring high-value farmland, as determined by the commission, within its urban growth boundary. (3) The inclusion of pilot project sites dedicated to affordable housing within an urban growth boundary pursuant to sections 2 to 9 of this 2016 Act does not authorize a local government to convert buildable lands within the urban growth boundary that are planned for needed housing, as defined in ORS 197.303 [renumbered 197A.348], to other uses. (4) Notwithstanding ORS 197.309 (2) [renumbered 197A.465 (2)], for a pilot project site selected under section 4 of this 2016 Act, and affordable housing developed on a selected pilot project site, a local government may take any action described in ORS 197.309 that has the effect of establishing the sales price for a housing unit or residential building lot or parcel, or that requires a housing unit or residential building lot or parcel to be designated for sale to a particular class or group of purchasers. (5) Sections 2 to 9 of this 2016 Act do not constitute a statutory contract. A pilot project site selected under section 4 of this 2016 Act and affordable housing developed on a selected pilot project site remain subject to new or additional regulatory requirements authorized by law, statewide land use planning goals and land use regulations implementing the goals. (6) As used in this section, lot and parcel have the meanings given those terms in ORS 92.010. [2016 c.52 8] Sec. 9. Reporting requirement. The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall report on the progress of the pilot program, in the manner provided in ORS 192.245, to the committees of the Legislative Assembly related to housing and human services: (1) At least once during each of three consecutive regular sessions of the Legislative Assembly, beginning with the 2017 regular session of the Legislative Assembly; and (2) At least once following adjournment sine die of the regular sessions of the Legislative Assembly described in subsection (1) of this section, but no later than the convening of the next regular session of the Legislative Assembly. [2016 c.52 9] Note: Section 2, chapter 112, Oregon Laws 2021, provides: Sec. 2. (1) Sections 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, chapter 52, Oregon Laws 2016, are repealed on January 2, 2028. (2) Section 4, chapter 52, Oregon Laws 2016, as amended by section 1, chapter 32, Oregon Laws 2019, section 1, chapter 112, Oregon Laws 2021, and section 1 of this 2023 Act, is repealed on January 2, 2028.

(3) When designating a rural reserve under this section to provide long-term protection to the agricultural industry, the designation must be based on consideration of factors including, but not limited to, whether land proposed for designation as a rural reserve: (a) Is situated in an area that is otherwise potentially subject to urbanization during the period described in subsection (2)(b) of this section, as indicated by proximity to the urban growth boundary and to properties with fair market values that significantly exceed agricultural values; (b) Is capable of sustaining long-term agricultural operations; (c) Has suitable soils and available water where needed to sustain long-term agricultural operations; and (d) Is suitable to sustain long-term agricultural operations, taking into account: (A) The existence of a large block of agricultural or other resource land with a concentration or cluster of farms; (B) The adjacent land use pattern, including its location in relation to adjacent nonfarm uses and the existence of buffers between agricultural operations and nonfarm uses; (C) The agricultural land use pattern, including parcelization, tenure and ownership patterns; and (D) The sufficiency of agricultural infrastructure in the area. (4) Designation and protection of rural reserves pursuant to this section or urban reserves pursuant to ORS 197A.245 (1): (a) Is not a basis for a claim for compensation under ORS 195.305 unless the designation and protection of rural reserves or urban reserves imposes a new restriction on the use of private real property. (b) Does not impair the rights and immunities provided under ORS 30.930 to 30.947. (5) The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall consult with the State Department of Agriculture in adopting, amending or repealing rules under this section. [Formerly 195.141]",

(4)(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection, the determination of housing capacity must be based on data related to land within the urban growth boundary that has been collected since the last review under subsection (2)(b) of this section. The data must include: (A) The number, density and average mix of housing types of urban residential development that have actually been developed; (B) Trends in density and average mix of housing types of urban residential development; (C) Market factors that may substantially impact future urban residential development; (D) The number, density and average mix of housing types that have been developed on buildable lands; (E) Consideration of the effects of the adopted housing production strategy and measures taken and reasonably anticipated to be taken to implement the strategy; and (F) Consideration of factors that influence available housing supply, including short-term rentals, second homes and vacation homes. (b) A local government shall make the determination described in paragraph (a) of this subsection using data from a shorter time period than the time period described in paragraph (a) of this subsection if the local government finds that the shorter time period will provide more accurate and reliable data related to housing capacity. The shorter time period may not be less than three years. (c) A local government shall use data from a wider geographic area or use a time period longer than the time period described in paragraph (a) of this subsection if the analysis of a wider geographic area or the use of data from a longer time period will provide more accurate, complete and reliable data related to trends affecting housing need than an analysis performed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection. The local government must clearly describe the geographic area, time frame and source of data used in a determination performed under this paragraph. (5) If the needed housing is greater than the housing capacity, the local government shall take one or both of the following actions to accommodate allocated housing need for which there is insufficient housing capacity to accommodate over the next 20 years: (a) Amend its urban growth boundary to include sufficient buildable lands to accommodate allocated housing need for the next 20 years consistent with the requirements of ORS 197A.285 and statewide planning goals. As part of this process, the local government shall consider the effects of actions taken pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection. The amendment must include sufficient land reasonably necessary to accommodate the siting of new public school facilities. The need and inclusion of lands for new public school facilities must be a coordinated process between the affected public school districts and the local government that has the authority to approve the urban growth boundary. (b) Take any action under ORS 197A.100 (3), whether or not the action was described in an approved housing production strategy, that demonstrably increases housing capacity or produces additional needed housing. Actions under this paragraph may include amending a comprehensive plan or land use regulations to include new measures that demonstrably increase the likelihood that residential development will occur at densities sufficient to accommodate needed housing for the next 20 years without expansion of the urban growth boundary. (6) A local government that takes any actions under subsection (5) of this section shall: (a) Demonstrate that the comprehensive plan and land use regulations comply with goals and rules adopted by the commission. (b) Adopt findings regarding the changes in housing capacity assumed to result from actions adopted based on data collected under subsection (4)(a) of this section. The density expectations may not project an increase in residential capacity above achieved density by more than three percent without quantifiable validation of such departures. A quantifiable validation must demonstrate that the assumed housing capacity has been achieved in areas that are zoned to allow no greater than the same authorized density level, as defined in ORS 227.175, within the local governments jurisdiction or a jurisdiction in the same region. (c) In establishing that actions adopted under subsection (5) of this section demonstrably increase housing capacity, ensure that buildable lands are in locations appropriate for needed housing, are zoned at density ranges that are likely to be achieved by the housing market and are in areas where sufficient urban services are planned to enable the higher density development to occur over the 20-year period.",

      "text": "Priority of land to be included within urban growth boundaries; rules. (1) A city outside Metro shall comply with this section when determining which lands to include within the urban growth boundary of the city, including when amending an urban growth boundary under ORS 197A.270 (5)(a), 197A.310 or 197A.312. (2) The Land Conservation and Development Commission shall provide, by rule, that: (a) When evaluating lands for inclusion within the urban growth boundary, the city shall establish a study area that includes all land that is contiguous to the urban growth boundary and within a distance specified by commission. (b) The city shall evaluate all land in the study area for inclusion in the urban growth boundary as provided in subsection (4) of this section, except for land excluded from the study area because: (A) It is impracticable, as provided in subsection (3) of this section, to provide necessary public facilities or services to the land. (B) The land is subject to significant development hazards, including a risk of land slides, a risk of flooding because the land is within the 100-year floodplain or is subject to inundation during storm surges or tsunamis, and other risks determined by the commission. (C) The long-term preservation of significant scenic, natural, cultural or recreational resources requires limiting or prohibiting urban development of the land that contains the resources. (D) The land is owned by the federal government and managed primarily for rural uses. (E) The land is designated as rural reserve under ORS 197A.230 to 197A.250. (c) When evaluating the priority of land for inclusion under paragraph (b) of this subsection: (A) The city shall evaluate the land within the study area that is designated as an urban reserve under ORS 197A.245 in an acknowledged comprehensive plan. (B) If the amount of land appropriate for selection under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is not sufficient to satisfy the need for the land, the city shall evaluate the land that is subject to an acknowledged exception under ORS 197.732 or land that is nonresource land and select as much of the land as necessary to satisfy the need for land using criteria established by the commission and criteria in an acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations. (C) If the amount of land appropriate for selection under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph is not sufficient to satisfy the need for land, the city shall evaluate the land within the study area that is designated as marginal land under ORS 197.247 (1991 Edition) in the acknowledged comprehensive plan and select as much of the land as necessary to satisfy the need for land using criteria established by the commission and criteria in an acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations. (D) If the amount of land appropriate for selection under subparagraphs (A) to (C) of this paragraph is not sufficient to satisfy the amount of land needed, the city shall evaluate land within the study area that is designated for agriculture or forest uses in the acknowledged comprehensive plan that is not predominantly high-value farmland, as defined in ORS 195.300, or does not consist predominantly of prime or unique soils, as determined by the United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, and select as much of that land as necessary to satisfy the need for land: (i) Using criteria established by the commission and criteria in an acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations; and (ii) Using the predominant capability classification system or the predominant cubic site class, as appropriate for the acknowledged comprehensive plan designation, to select lower capability or cubic site class lands first. (E) If the amount of land appropriate for selection under subparagraphs (A) to (D) of this paragraph is not sufficient to satisfy the need for land, the city shall evaluate land within the study area that is designated as agricultural land in an acknowledged comprehensive plan and is predominantly high value farmland and select as much of that land as necessary to satisfy the need for land. A local government may not select land that is predominantly made up of prime or unique farm soils, as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, unless there is an insufficient amount of other land to satisfy its land need. (3) For purposes of subsection (2)(b)(A) of this section, the commission shall determine impracticability by rule, considering the likely amount of development that could occur on the lands within the planning period, the likely cost of facilities and services, physical, topographical or other impediments to service provision and whether urban development has occurred on similarly situated lands such that it is likely that the lands will be developed at an urban level during the planning period. When impracticability is primarily a result of existing development patterns, the rules of the commission shall require that the lands be included within the study area, but may allow the development capacity forecast for the lands to be specified at a lower level over the planning period. The rules of the commission must be based on an evaluation of how similarly situated lands have, or have not, developed over time. (4) For purposes of subsection (2)(b)(C) of this section, the commission by rule shall determine the circumstances in which and the resources to which this exclusion will apply. (5) Notwithstanding subsection (2)(c)(E) of this section, the rules must allow land that would otherwise be excluded from an urban growth boundary to be included if: (a) The land contains a small amount of resource land that is not important to the commercial agricultural enterprise in the area and the land must be included to connect a nearby and significantly larger area of land of higher priority for inclusion within the urban growth boundary; or (b) The land contains a small amount of resource land that is not predominantly high-value farmland or predominantly made up of prime or unique farm soils and the land is completely surrounded by land of higher priority for inclusion into the urban growth boundary. (6) When the primary purpose for expansion of the urban growth boundary is to accommodate a particular industry use that requires specific site characteristics, or to accommodate a public facility that requires specific site characteristics and the site characteristics may be found in only a small number of locations, the city may limit the study area to land that has, or could be improved to provide, the required site characteristics. Lands included within an urban growth boundary for a particular industrial use, or a particular public facility, must remain planned and zoned for the intended use: (a) Except as allowed by rule of the commission that is based on a significant change in circumstance or the passage of time; or (b) Unless the city removes the land from within the urban growth boundary. (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commission may adopt rules that specify circumstances under which a city may exchange land within the urban growth boundary of the city for land that is outside of the urban growth boundary and that is designed to avoid adverse effects of an exchange on agricultural or forest operations in the surrounding area.

      "text": "Cities with population of less than 10,000; rules. (1) As an alternative to the method prescribed in ORS 197A.270 (5)(a), the Land Conservation and Development Commission shall adopt a method by which a city outside Metro that has a population of less than 10,000 may evaluate or amend its urban growth boundary. (2) The commission shall design the method so that: (a) A city using the method: (A) Will have within its boundaries sufficient buildable lands and other development capacity, including land and capacity for needed housing and employment opportunities, to meet the growth in population and employment forecast to occur over a 14-year period. (B) Will not become less efficient in its use of land as a result of a change to the urban growth boundary. (b) The urban population per square mile will continue, subject to market conditions, to increase over time on a statewide basis and in major regions of the state, including that portion of the Willamette Valley outside of Metro. (c) The rate of conversion of agricultural and forest lands to urban uses does not increase over time in any major region of the state. (3) Under the method adopted by the commission: (a) A citys determination of the amount of buildable lands sufficient for needed housing, employment and other urban uses must be based on the population and employment growth forecast to occur over a 14-year period. (b) A citys determination of the supply and development capacity of lands within its urban growth boundary must be based on: (A) A simple inventory of vacant and partially vacant buildable lands within the urban growth boundary; (B) The comprehensive plan designation and the zoning of the portion of the buildable lands that is urban; and (C) Simple factors established by the commission for forecasting: (i) The development and redevelopment capacity of urbanizable lands within the urban growth boundary; and (ii) The redevelopment capacity of developed urban lands within the urban growth boundary. (c) A citys determination of the supply and development capacity of lands the city proposes to include within the urban growth boundary must be based on: (A) A simple inventory of vacant and partially vacant lands; and (B) Simple factors established by the commission for forecasting the development and redevelopment capacity of the lands. (d) A city shall demonstrate that lands included within the urban growth boundary: (A) Include sufficient serviceable land for at least a seven-year period. (B) Can all be serviceable over a 14-year period. (e) Lands included within the urban growth boundary: (A) Must be planned and zoned for categories of land uses in amounts that are roughly proportional to the land need determined for each category of use; (B) Must be planned and zoned for an intensity of use that is generally consistent with the estimates that were used to determine the amount of land needed; (C) Must be planned and zoned to meet the requirements for needed housing, and those requirements must be specified by rule of the commission in a manner that is as objective as practicable; and (D) May be either: (i) Planned and zoned, or otherwise conditioned, to avoid significantly affecting a state highway, a state highway interchange or a freight route designated in the Oregon Highway Plan; or (ii) Allowed to significantly affect a state highway, a state highway interchange or a freight route designated in the Oregon Highway Plan subject to mitigation, consistent with rules of the commission, if the lands are planned and zoned for compact urban development or industrial uses. (4) For purposes of subsection (3)(a) of this section, population growth must be forecast as provided in ORS 195.033. Employment growth must be forecast based on the population growth forecast for the city or the employment growth forecast issued by the Employment Department for the county or region. The commission shall establish factors, by rule, for converting the forecasted population and employment growth into forecasts of land need for housing, employment and other categories of uses. The factors must: (a) Be based on an empirical evaluation of the relation between population and employment growth and the rate and trends of land utilization in the recent past in the applicable major region of the state; (b) Reflect consideration by the commission of any significant changes occurring or expected to occur in the markets for urban land uses in that major region of the state; (c) Be designed to encourage an increase in the land use efficiency of a city, subject to market conditions; and (d) Provide a range of policy choices for a city about the form of its future growth. (5) For purposes of subsection (3)(b) of this section, the commission shall establish factors for supply and development capacity that are: (a) Based on an empirical evaluation of the population and employment growth that has occurred on similarly situated lands through development and redevelopment; (b) Based on consideration by the commission of any significant changes occurring or expected to occur in the markets for urban land uses in that major region of the state; (c) Designed to encourage an increase in the land use efficiency of the city, subject to market conditions; and (d) Designed to provide a range of policy choices for a city about the form of its future growth. (6) For purposes of subsection (3)(c) of this section, the commission shall establish factors that are: (a) Based on an empirical evaluation of the population and employment growth that has occurred on similarly situated lands through development and redevelopment; (b) Based on consideration by the commission of any significant changes occurring or expected to occur in the markets for urban land uses in each major region of the state; (c) Designed to encourage an increase in the land use efficiency of the city, subject to market conditions; and (d) Designed to provide a range of policy choices for a city about the form of its future growth. (7) For lands that are included within an urban growth boundary pursuant to this section and not made serviceable within 20 years after the date of their inclusion, the commission may provide by rule that: (a) The lands must be removed from within the urban growth boundary the next time the city evaluates the urban growth boundary; or (b) The planned development capacity of the lands must be reduced if there are significant increases in the cost of making the lands serviceable. (8) When lands included within the urban growth boundary pursuant to this section are planned and zoned for industrial or residential uses, the lands must remain planned and zoned for the use unless a rule of the commission allows a change in planning and zoning based on a significant change in circumstance.",

(1) As an alternative to the method prescribed in ORS 197A.270 (5)(a), the Land Conservation and Development Commission shall adopt a method by which a city outside Metro that has a population of 10,000 or greater may evaluate or amend its urban growth boundary. (2) The commission shall design the method so that: (a) A city using the method: (A) Will have within its boundaries sufficient buildable lands and other development capacity, including land and capacity for needed housing and employment opportunities, to meet the growth in population and employment forecast to occur over a 14-year period. (B) Will not become less efficient in its use of land as a result of a change to the urban growth boundary. (b) The urban population per square mile will continue to increase over time on a statewide basis and in major regions of the state, including that portion of the Willamette Valley outside of Metro. (c) The rate of conversion of agricultural and forest lands to urban uses does not increase over time in any major region of the state. (3) Under the method adopted by the commission: (a) A citys determination of the amount of buildable lands sufficient for needed housing, employment and other urban uses must be based on the population and employment growth forecast to occur over a 14-year period. (b) A citys determination of the supply and development capacity of lands within its urban growth boundary must be based on: (A) An inventory of vacant and partially vacant buildable lands within the urban growth boundary; (B) The comprehensive plan designation and the zoning of the portion of the buildable lands that is urban; and (C) Factors established by the commission for forecasting: (i) The development and redevelopment capacity of urbanizable lands within the urban growth boundary; and (ii) The redevelopment capacity of developed urban lands within the urban growth boundary. (c) A citys determination of the supply and development capacity of lands the city proposes to include within the urban growth boundary must be based on: (A) An inventory of vacant and partially vacant lands; and (B) Factors established by the commission for forecasting the development and redevelopment capacity of the lands. (d) A city shall consider a range or combination of measures identified by rule of the commission to accommodate future need for land within the urban growth boundary and implement at least one measure or satisfy an alternate performance standard established by the commission. The commission shall design the alternate performance standard so that the standard is satisfied when the city: (A) Has a development code that contains specified provisions designed to encourage the development of needed housing; and (B) Demonstrates that, during the preceding planning period, the city: (i) If located in the Willamette Valley, exceeded the median rate of redevelopment and infill for cities with a population of 10,000 or greater in the Willamette Valley that are outside of the boundaries of Metro by an amount set by commission rule; and (ii) If located outside of the Willamette Valley, exceeded the median rate of redevelopment and infill for cities with a population of 10,000 or greater that are outside the Willamette Valley by an amount set by commission rule. (e) A city shall demonstrate that lands included within the urban growth boundary: (A) Include sufficient serviceable land for at least a seven-year period. (B) Can all be serviceable over a 14-year period. (f) Lands included within the urban growth boundary: (A) Must be planned and zoned for categories of land uses in amounts that are roughly proportional to the land need determined for each category of use; (B) Must be planned and zoned for an intensity of use that is generally consistent with the estimates that were used to determine the amount of land needed; (C) Must be planned and zoned to meet the requirements for needed housing, and those requirements must be specified by rule of the commission in a manner that is as objective as practicable; and (D) May be either: (i) Planned and zoned, or otherwise conditioned, to avoid significantly affecting a state highway, a state highway interchange or a freight route designated in the Oregon Highway Plan; or (ii) Allowed to significantly affect a state highway, a state highway interchange or a freight route designated in the Oregon Highway Plan subject to mitigation, consistent with rules of the commission, if the lands are planned and zoned for compact urban development or industrial uses. (4) For purposes of subsection (3)(a) of this section, population growth must be forecast as provided in ORS 195.033. Employment growth must be forecast based on the population growth forecast for the city or the employment growth forecast issued by the Employment Department for the county or region. The commission shall establish factors, by rule, for converting the forecasted population and employment growth into forecasts of land need for housing, employment and other categories of uses. The factors must: (a) Be based on an empirical evaluation of the relation between population and employment growth and the rate and trends of land utilization in the recent past in the applicable major region of the state; (b) Reflect consideration by the commission of any significant changes occurring or expected to occur in the markets for urban land uses in that major region of the state; (c) Be designed to encourage an increase in the land use efficiency of a city, subject to market conditions; and (d) Provide a range of policy choices for a city about the form of its future growth. (5) For purposes of subsection (3)(b) of this section, the commission shall establish factors for supply and development capacity that are: (a) Based on an empirical evaluation of the population and employment growth that has occurred on similarly situated lands through development and redevelopment; (b) Based on consideration by the commission of any significant changes occurring or expected to occur in the markets for urban land uses in that major region of the state; (c) Designed to encourage an increase in the land use efficiency of the city, subject to market conditions; and (d) Designed to provide a range of policy choices for a city about the form of its future growth. (6) For purposes of subsection (3)(c) of this section, the commission shall establish factors that are: (a) Based on an empirical evaluation of the population and employment growth that has occurred on similarly situated lands through development and redevelopment; (b) Based on consideration by the commission of any significant changes occurring or expected to occur in the markets for urban land uses in each major region of the state; (c) Designed to encourage an increase in the land use efficiency of the city, subject to market conditions; and (d) Designed to provide a range of policy choices for a city about the form of its future growth. (7) For lands that are included within an urban growth boundary pursuant to this section and not made serviceable within 20 years after the date of their inclusion, the commission may provide by rule that: (a) The lands must be removed from within the urban growth boundary the next time the city evaluates the urban growth boundary; or (b) The planned development capacity of the lands must be reduced if there are significant increases in the cost of making the lands serviceable. (8) When lands included within the urban growth boundary pursuant to this section are planned and zoned for industrial or residential uses, the lands must remain planned and zoned for the use unless a rule of the commission allows a change in planning and zoning based on a significant change in circumstance.",

      "text": "Determination of housing capacity and accommodation of needed housing by Metro. (1) This section applies only to Metro. (2)(a) Metro shall demonstrate that its regional framework plan provides sufficient buildable lands within the urban growth boundary established pursuant to statewide planning goals to accommodate estimated housing needs for 20 years: (A) At periodic review under ORS 197.628 to 197.651; (B) As scheduled by the Land Conservation and Development Commission at least once each six years; or (C) At any other legislative review of the regional framework plan that concerns the urban growth boundary and requires the application of a statewide planning goal relating to buildable lands for residential use. (b) The 20-year period shall commence on the date initially scheduled for completion of the review under paragraph (a) of this subsection. (3) In performing the duties under subsection (2) of this section, Metro shall: (a) Inventory the supply of buildable lands within the urban growth boundary and determine the housing capacity of the buildable lands; and (b) Conduct an analysis of existing and projected housing need by type and density range, in accordance with all factors under ORS 197A.348 and statewide planning goals and rules relating to housing, to determine the number of units and amount of land needed for each needed housing type for the next 20 years. (4)(a) For the purpose of the inventory described in subsection (3)(a) of this section, buildable lands includes: (A) Vacant lands planned or zoned for residential use; (B) Partially vacant lands planned or zoned for residential use; (C) Lands that may be used for a mix of residential and employment uses under the existing planning or zoning; and (D) Lands that may be used for residential infill or redevelopment. (b) For the purpose of the inventory and determination of housing capacity described in subsection (3)(a) of this section, Metro must demonstrate consideration of: (A) The extent that residential development is prohibited or restricted by local regulation and ordinance, state law and rule or federal statute and regulation; (B) A written long term contract or easement for radio, telecommunications or electrical facilities, if the written contract or easement is provided to Metro; (C) The presence of a single family dwelling or other structure on a lot or parcel; and (D) Factors that influence available housing supply, including short-term rentals, second homes and vacation homes. (c) Except for land that may be used for residential infill or redevelopment, Metro shall create a map or document that may be used to verify and identify specific lots or parcels that have been determined to be buildable lands. (5)(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection, the determination of housing capacity pursuant to subsection (3)(a) of this section must be based on data relating to land within the urban growth boundary that has been collected since the last review under subsection (2)(a)(B) of this section. The data shall include: (A) The number, density and average mix of housing types of urban residential development that have actually occurred; (B) Trends in density and average mix of housing types of urban residential development; (C) Market factors that may substantially impact future urban residential development; and (D) The number, density and average mix of housing types that have occurred on the buildable lands described in subsection (4)(a) of this section. (b) Metro shall make the determination described in paragraph (a) of this subsection using a shorter time period than the time period described in paragraph (a) of this subsection if Metro finds that the shorter time period will provide more accurate and reliable data related to housing capacity. The shorter time period may not be less than three years. (c) Metro shall use data from a wider geographic area or use a time period longer than the time period described in paragraph (a) of this subsection if the analysis of a wider geographic area or the use of a longer time period will provide more accurate, complete and reliable data relating to trends affecting housing need than an analysis performed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection. Metro must clearly describe the geographic area, time frame and source of data used in a determination performed under this paragraph. (6) If the housing need determined pursuant to subsection (3)(b) of this section is greater than the housing capacity determined pursuant to subsection (3)(a) of this section, Metro shall take one or both of the following actions to accommodate the additional housing need: (a) Amend its urban growth boundary to include sufficient buildable lands to accommodate housing needs for the next 20 years. As part of this process, Metro shall consider the effects of measures taken pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection. The amendment shall include sufficient land reasonably necessary to accommodate the siting of new public school facilities. The need and inclusion of lands for new public school facilities shall be a coordinated process between the affected public school districts and Metro that has the authority to approve the urban growth boundary. (b) Amend its regional framework plan, functional plan or land use regulations to include new measures that demonstrably increase the likelihood that residential development will occur at densities sufficient to accommodate housing needs for the next 20 years without expansion of the urban growth boundary. If Metro takes this action, Metro shall adopt findings regarding the density expectations assumed to result from measures adopted under this paragraph based upon the factors listed in ORS 197A.348 (2) and data in subsection (5)(a) of this section. The density expectations may not project an increase in residential capacity above achieved density by more than three percent without quantifiable validation of such departures. A quantifiable validation must demonstrate that the assumed housing capacity has been achieved in areas within Metro that are zoned to allow no greater than the same authorized density level, as defined in ORS 227.175. (7) Using the housing need analysis conducted under subsection (3)(b) of this section, Metro shall determine the overall average density and overall mix of housing types at which residential development of needed housing types must occur in order to meet housing needs over the next 20 years. If that density is greater than the actual density of development determined under subsection (5)(a)(A) of this section, or if that mix is different from the actual mix of housing types determined under subsection (5)(a)(A) of this section, Metro, as part of its periodic review, shall adopt measures that demonstrably increase the likelihood that residential development will occur at the housing types and density and at the mix of housing types required to meet housing needs over the next 20 years. (8) Metro shall determine the density and mix of housing types anticipated as a result of actions taken under subsections (6) and (7) of this section and monitor and record the actual density and mix of housing types achieved following the adoption of these actions. Metro shall compare actual and anticipated density and mix. Metro shall submit its comparison to the commission at the next review of its urban growth boundary under subsection (2)(a) of this section. (9) In establishing that actions and measures adopted under subsections (6) and (7) of this section demonstrably increase the likelihood of higher density residential development, Metro shall at a minimum ensure that land zoned for needed housing is in locations appropriate for the housing types identified under subsection (3) of this section, is zoned at density ranges that are likely to be achieved by the housing market using the analysis in subsection (3) of this section and is in areas where sufficient urban services are planned to enable the higher density development to occur over the 20-year period. Actions or measures, or both, may include those actions listed in ORS 197A.100 (3). [Formerly 197.296]",

      "text": "Affordable housing allowed outright; commercial conversion to residential use; affordable housing density bonus. (1) As used in this section: (a) Affordable housing means residential property: (A) In which: (i) Each unit on the property is made available to own or rent to families with incomes of 80 percent or less of the area median income; (ii) The average of all units on the property is made available to families with incomes of 60 percent or less of the area median income; or (iii) A manufactured dwelling park is operated that serves only households with incomes of 120 percent or less of the area median income; and (B) Whose affordability, including affordability under a covenant as described in ORS 456.270 to 456.295, is enforceable for a duration of no less than 30 years. (b) Area median income means the median income for the metropolitan statistical area in which housing is located as determined by the Housing and Community Services Department and adjusted for household size based on information from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. (2) A local government shall allow affordable housing if the proposed affordable housing is on property that is: (a) Owned by: (A) A public body, as defined in ORS 174.109; (B) A nonprofit corporation that is organized as a religious corporation; (C) A nonprofit corporation that is organized as a public benefit corporation whose primary purpose is the development of affordable housing; (D) A housing authority, as defined in ORS 456.005; or (E) A manufactured dwelling park nonprofit cooperative, as defined in ORS 62.803; or (b) Zoned: (A) For commercial uses; (B) To allow religious assembly; or (C) As public lands. (3) A local government shall allow the conversion of a building or a portion of a building from a commercial use to a residential use. (4) Subsections (2) and (3) of this section: (a) Prohibit the local government from requiring a zone change or conditional use permit before allowing the use. (b) Do not trigger any requirement that a local government consider or update an analysis as required by a statewide planning goal relating to economic development. (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection, do not apply on lands where the local government determines that: (A) The development on the property cannot be adequately served by water, sewer, storm water drainage or streets, or will not be adequately served at the time that development on the lot is complete; (B) The property contains a slope of 25 percent or greater; (C) The property is within a 100-year floodplain; or (D) The development of the property is constrained by land use regulations based on statewide land use planning goals relating to: (i) Natural disasters and hazards; or (ii) Natural resources, including air, water, land or natural areas, but not including open spaces or historic resources. (d) Do apply to property described in paragraph (c)(C) and (D)(i) of this subsection if more than 60 percent of the lands within the urban growth boundary that the property is within are located within a tsunami inundation zone or if more than 30 percent of the lands within the urban growth boundary that the property is within are located within a 100-year floodplain. (5) The development of housing under subsection (2) of this section may occur only: (a) Within an urban growth boundary; and (b) On lands zoned to allow for industrial uses only if the property is: (A) Publicly owned; (B) Adjacent to lands zoned for residential uses or schools; and (C) Not specifically designated for heavy industrial uses. (6) The development of housing under subsection (3) of this section: (a) Applies only within an urban growth boundary of a city with a population of 10,000 or greater; (b) May not occur on lands zoned to allow industrial uses; (c) May require the payment of a system development charge as defined in ORS 223.299 only if: (A) The charge is calculated pursuant to a specific adopted policy for commercial to residential conversions adopted on or before December 31, 2023; or (B) The charge is for water or wastewater and includes an offset for at least 100 percent of the water or wastewater system development charges paid when the building was originally constructed; and (d) May not be subject to enforcement of any land use regulation that establishes a minimum number of parking spaces that is greater than the lesser of: (A) The amount that may be required for the existing commercial use; or (B) The amount that may be required in lands zoned for residential uses that would allow the converted development. (7) The development of housing allowed under subsection (4)(d) of this section may only occur: (a) Within an urban growth boundary located no more than 10 miles from the Pacific Ocean; (b) In areas that require compliance with minimum federal regulations under the National Flood Insurance Program or with local floodplain development regulations adopted by the applicable local government, provided that the local regulations are equal to or more stringent than the minimum federal regulations; (c) In locations that do not include floodways or other areas with higher risks of greater water velocity and debris flow; (d) In communities with emergency response, evacuation and post-disaster plans that have been updated for the housing development; and (e) In areas that are not public parks. (8) A local government may prohibit affordable housing or require a zone change or conditional use permit to develop affordable housing in areas described in subsection (4)(d) of this section. (9) A local government shall approve an application at an authorized density level and authorized height level, as defined in ORS 227.175 (4), for the development of affordable housing, at the greater of: (a) Any local density bonus for affordable housing; or (b) Without consideration of any local density bonus for affordable housing: (A) For property with existing maximum density of 16 or fewer units per acre, 200 percent of the existing density and 12 additional feet; (B) For property with existing maximum density of 17 or more units per acre and 45 or fewer units per acre, 150 percent of the existing density and 24 additional feet; or (C) For property with existing maximum density of 46 or more units per acre, 125 percent of the existing density and 36 additional feet. (10)(a) Subsection (9) of this section does not apply to housing allowed under subsection (2) of this section in areas that are not zoned for residential uses. (b) A local government may reduce the density or height of the density bonus allowed under subsection (9) of this section as necessary to address a health, safety or habitability issue, including fire safety, or to comply with a protective measure adopted pursuant to a statewide land use planning goal. Notwithstanding ORS 197.350, the local government must adopt findings supported by substantial evidence demonstrating the necessity of this reduction. [Formerly 197.308]",

      "text": "Local requirements to develop affordable housing. (1) As used in this section: (a) Affordable housing means housing that is affordable to households with incomes equal to or higher than 80 percent of the median family income for the county in which the housing is built. (b) Multifamily structure means a structure that contains three or more housing units sharing at least one wall, floor or ceiling surface in common with another unit within the same structure. (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a metropolitan service district may not adopt a land use regulation or functional plan provision, or impose as a condition for approving a permit under ORS 215.427 or 227.178 a requirement, that has the effect of establishing the sales or rental price for a housing unit or residential building lot or parcel, or that requires a housing unit or residential building lot or parcel to be designated for sale or rent to a particular class or group of purchasers or renters. (3) The provisions of subsection (2) of this section do not limit the authority of a metropolitan service district to: (a) Adopt or enforce a use regulation, provision or requirement creating or implementing an incentive, contract commitment, density bonus or other voluntary regulation, provision or requirement designed to increase the supply of moderate or lower cost housing units; or (b) Enter into an affordable housing covenant as provided in ORS 456.270 to 456.295. (4) Notwithstanding ORS 91.225, a city or county may adopt a land use regulation or functional plan provision, or impose as a condition for approving a permit under ORS 215.427 or 227.178 a requirement, that has the effect of establishing the sales or rental price for a new multifamily structure, or that requires a new multifamily structure to be designated for sale or rent as affordable housing. (5) A regulation, provision or requirement adopted or imposed under subsection (4) of this section: (a) May not require more than 20 percent of housing units within a multifamily structure to be sold or rented as affordable housing. (b) May apply only to multifamily structures containing at least 20 housing units. (c) Must provide developers the option to pay an in-lieu fee, in an amount determined by the city or county, in exchange for providing the requisite number of housing units within the multifamily structure to be sold or rented at below-market rates. (d) Must require the city or county to offer a developer of multifamily structures, other than a developer that elects to pay an in-lieu fee pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection, at least one of the following incentives: (A) Whole or partial fee waivers or reductions. (B) Whole or partial waivers of system development charges or impact fees set by the city or county. (C) Finance-based incentives. (D) Full or partial exemption from ad valorem property taxes on the terms described in this subparagraph. For purposes of any statute granting a full or partial exemption from ad valorem property taxes that uses a definition of low income to mean income at or below 60 percent of the area median income and for which the multifamily structure is otherwise eligible, the city or county shall allow the multifamily structure of the developer to qualify using a definition of low income to mean income at or below 80 percent of the area median income. (e) Does not apply to a CCRC, as defined in ORS 101.020, that executes and records a covenant with the applicable city or county in which the CCRC agrees to operate all units within its structure as a CCRC. Units within a CCRC that are offered or converted into residential units that are for sale or rent and are not subject to ORS chapter 101 must comply with regulations, provisions or requirements adopted by the city or county that are consistent with those applicable to a new multifamily structure under subsection (3) or (4) of this section. (6) A regulation, provision or requirement adopted or imposed under subsection (4) of this section may offer developers one or more of the following incentives: (a) Density adjustments. (b) Expedited service for local permitting processes. (c) Modification of height, floor area or other site-specific requirements. (d) Other incentives as determined by the city or county. (7) Subsection (4) of this section does not restrict the authority of a city or county to offer developers voluntary incentives, including incentives to: (a) Increase the number of affordable housing units in a development. (b) Decrease the sale or rental price of affordable housing units in a development. (c) Build affordable housing units that are affordable to households with incomes equal to or lower than 80 percent of the median family income for the county in which the housing is built. (8)(a) A city or county that adopts or imposes a regulation, provision or requirement described in subsection (4) of this section may not apply the regulation, provision or requirement to any multifamily structure for which an application for a permit, as defined in ORS 215.402 or 227.160, has been submitted as provided in ORS 215.416 or 227.178 (3), or, if such a permit is not required, a building permit application has been submitted to the city or county prior to the effective date of the regulation, provision or requirement. (b) If a multifamily structure described in paragraph (a) of this subsection has not been completed within the period required by the permit issued by the city or county, the developer of the multifamily structure shall resubmit an application for a permit, as defined in ORS 215.402 or 227.160, as provided in ORS 215.416 or 227.178 (3), or, if such a permit is not required, a building permit application under the regulation, provision or requirement adopted by the city or county under subsection (4) of this section. (9)(a) A city or county that adopts or imposes a regulation, provision or requirement under subsection (4) of this section shall adopt and apply only clear and objective standards, conditions and procedures regulating the development of affordable housing units within its jurisdiction. The standards, conditions and procedures may not have the effect, either individually or cumulatively, of discouraging development of affordable housing units through unreasonable cost or delay. (b) Paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply to: (A) An application or permit for residential development in an area identified in a formally adopted central city plan, or a regional center as defined by Metro, in a city with a population of 500,000 or more. (B) An application or permit for residential development in historic areas designated for protection under a land use planning goal protecting historic areas. (c) In addition to an approval process for affordable housing based on clear and objective standards, conditions and procedures as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, a city or county may adopt and apply an alternative approval process for applications and permits for residential development based on approval criteria regulating, in whole or in part, appearance or aesthetics that are not clear and objective if: (A) The developer retains the option of proceeding under the approval process that meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection; (B) The approval criteria for the alternative approval process comply with applicable statewide land use planning goals and rules; and (C) The approval criteria for the alternative approval process authorize a density at or above the density level authorized in the zone under the approval process provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection. (10) If a regulation, provision or requirement adopted or imposed by a city or county under subsection (4) of this section requires that a percentage of housing units in a new multifamily structure be designated as affordable housing, any incentives offered under subsection (5)(d) or (6) of this section shall be related in a manner determined by the city or county to the required percentage of affordable housing units.

(1) As used in this section: (a) Affordable housing means housing that is affordable to households with incomes equal to or less than 60 percent of the median family income for the county in which the development is built or for the state, whichever is greater, that is subject to an affordable housing covenant, as provided in ORS 456.270 to 456.295, that maintains the affordability for a period of not less than 60 years from the date of the certificate of occupancy. (b) Multifamily residential building means a building in which three or more residential units each have space for eating, living and sleeping and permanent provisions for cooking and sanitation. (2) Notwithstanding ORS 215.427 (1) or 227.178 (1), a city with a population greater than 5,000 or a county with a population greater than 25,000 shall take final action on an application qualifying under subsection (3) of this section, including resolution of all local appeals under ORS 215.422 or 227.180, within 100 days after the application is deemed complete. (3) An application qualifies for final action within the timeline described in subsection (2) of this section if: (a) The application is submitted to the city or the county under ORS 215.416 or 227.175; (b) The application is for development of a multifamily residential building containing five or more residential units within the urban growth boundary; and (c) At least 50 percent of the residential units included in the development will be sold or rented as affordable housing. (4) A city or a county shall take final action within the time allowed under ORS 215.427 or 227.178 on any application for a permit, limited land use decision or zone change that does not qualify for review and decision under subsection (3) of this section, including resolution of all appeals under ORS 215.422 or 227.180, as provided by ORS 215.427 and 215.435 or by ORS 227.178 and 227.181.

(4) Within seven days following filing of the petition for judicial review, the commission shall personally deliver or electronically submit to the State Court Administrator a certified copy of the record of the criteria proceedings. The record shall include only: (a) The published notice of public hearing; (b) The proposed criteria submitted as described in ORS 197A.505 (6)(b) and by written testimony submitted to the commission at the hearing; (c) Any written report received by the commission from the Department of Land Conservation and Development at the hearing; (d) Minutes of the hearing; (e) The order establishing the criteria; and (f) Proof of mailing to persons entitled to written notice of the order and the criteria under ORS 197A.505 (9)(b). (5) Within 14 days following the filing of the petition for judicial review, the petitioner shall file a petitioners brief with the State Court Administrator. The brief must comply with the specifications for opening briefs set forth in the rules of appellate procedure. The petitioner shall personally deliver a copy of the brief to: (a) The Attorney General; (b) The Metro Council, at the office of Metros executive officer; (c) TriMet, at the office of TriMets general manager; and (d) Each affected local government. (6) The court shall consider the petitioner to be adversely affected if: (a) The petitioner provided oral or written testimony at the hearing; and (b) The petitioner proposed criteria in the manner described in ORS 197A.505 (6)(b) that the commission rejected in its order or the petitioner, in the petitioners testimony at the hearing, opposed the criteria that the commission established in its order. (7) Within 28 days following the filing of the petition for judicial review, an answering brief complying with the rules of appellate procedure may be filed by any of the following: (a) The commission; (b) Metro, unless Metro is the petitioner; (c) TriMet, unless TriMet is the petitioner; (d) The Department of Transportation, unless the Department of Transportation is the petitioner; or (e) Any affected local government, unless the local government is the petitioner.

(b) Failure of the commission to notify a person entitled to written notice under ORS 197A.505 (9)(b) is not grounds for reversal or remand if the commission provides evidence of mailing the notice to that person. (c) The court may not substitute its judgment for that of the commission as to any issue of fact or as to any issue within the discretion of the commission.

(2)(a) The steering committee shall issue recommendations for the siting of the light rail route and other project improvements and their locations to TriMet. (b) TriMet shall apply to the Metro Council for a land use final order approving the project improvements and their locations. The applied for locations must provide sufficient boundaries to accommodate adjustments to the specific placements of the project improvements for which need commonly arises upon the development of more detailed environmental or engineering data following approval of a Full Funding Grant Agreement. (3) The council shall apply the criteria established by the Land Conservation and Development Commission under ORS 197A.505 when making decisions in a land use final order on the applied for project improvements, including their locations. The council shall follow the procedures described in this section when adopting a land use final order. (4) The council shall hold a public hearing on the project improvements, including their locations, for which decisions will be made in the land use final order.

The notice shall state: (A) The general subject matter of the hearing and all matters scheduled for consideration at the hearing; (B) The date, time and place of the hearing; (C) The street address where a staff report and the criteria may be found; (D) That failure by a person to raise an issue at the hearing in person or in writing, or failure to provide sufficient specificity to afford the council an opportunity to respond to the issue raised, shall preclude appeal by that person to the Land Use Board of Appeals based on that issue; (E) That persons whose names appear on petitions submitted into the public hearing record will not be considered by that action to have provided oral or written testimony at the hearing; (F) That notice of adoption of the land use final order will be provided only to persons who provide oral or written testimony at the hearing and who also provide a written request for notice and a mailing address to which notice shall be sent; and (G) That appeals from decisions in a land use final order must be filed within 14 days following the date the land use final order is reduced to writing and bears the necessary signatures. (b) The council also shall provide such other notice as the council deems necessary to give notice to persons who may be substantially affected by its decision. No other form of notice is required. (6)(a) At least seven days prior to the hearing, the council shall make a copy of the staff report available for public inspection. The staff report shall: (A) Set forth the criteria established under ORS 197A.505; (B) Include a description of the proposed boundaries within which the project improvements will be located, as applied for by TriMet under subsection (2) of this section; and (C) Address how the proposed boundaries comply with the criteria. (b) Without providing additional notice, the council may amend the staff report prior to the hearing as the staff considers necessary or desirable. (7) At the commencement of the hearing, a statement shall be made to those in attendance that: (a) Lists the criteria or directs those present to a place at the hearing location where any person may obtain a list of the criteria at no cost; (b) Lists generally the project improvements, including their locations, for which decisions will be made in the land use final order; (c) Testimony shall be directed toward the application of the criteria to the project improvements, including their locations, to which decisions will be made in the land use final order; (d) Failure by a person to raise an issue at the hearing, in person or in writing, or failure to raise an issue with sufficient specificity to afford the council an opportunity to respond to the issue raised, shall preclude appeal by that person to the board based on that issue; (e) Persons whose names appear on petitions submitted into the public hearing record will not be considered by that action to have provided oral or written testimony at the hearing; (f) Notice of adoption of the land use final order will be provided only to the affected local governments and to the persons who have provided oral or written testimony at the hearing and who also have provided a written request for notice and a mailing address to which notice shall be sent; and (g) Appeals from decisions in a land use final order on the project improvements, including their locations, must be filed within 14 days following the date the land use final order is reduced to writing and bears the necessary signatures. (8)(a) The council shall allow for the submission of oral and written testimony at the hearing, subject to any hearing procedures the council deems necessary or appropriate for the adoption of a land use final order. (b) The council may exclude irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious testimony. (9) The council may take official notice at the hearing of any matter identified in ORS 40.065 and 40.090 or as authorized by resolution of the council establishing hearing procedures for the adoption of land use final orders. (10) The council is not required to provide any opportunities in addition to those described in this section for interested persons to participate in the proceedings of the council in adopting a land use final order. The council may establish by resolution additional procedures to govern its proceedings in adopting a land use final order, subject to the provisions of this section. (11) The council shall close the hearing and shall adopt a land use final order by resolution or continue the matter as provided in ORS 197A.511 (1) or as the council otherwise considers necessary for the purpose of adopting a land use final order.
