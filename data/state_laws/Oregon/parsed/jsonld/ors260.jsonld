(4) Each public employer shall have posted in a conspicuous place likely to be seen by its employees the following notice in printed or typewritten form: ______________________________________________________________________________ ATTENTION ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES: The restrictions imposed by the law of the State of Oregon on your political activities are that No public employee shall solicit any money, influence, service or other thing of value or otherwise promote or oppose any political committee; promote or oppose the appointment, nomination or election of a person to a public office; or promote or oppose the filing of or gathering of signatures on an initiative, referendum or recall petition or the adoption of a measure or the recall of a public office holder while on the job during working hours or while otherwise acting in the public employees official capacity as a public employee. However, this section does not restrict the right of a public employee to express personal political views, provided that a reasonable person would not infer that the views represent those of the public employer of the public employee. It is therefore the policy of the state and of your public employer that you may engage in political activity except to the extent prohibited by state law when on the job during working hours or while otherwise working in your official capacity as a public employee. ______________________________________________________________________________ (5)(a) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) of this section: (A) The recognized student government of a community college or public university listed in ORS 352.002, or a member of the recognized student government while acting as a member, may make a statement or issue a resolution to promote or oppose: (i) The gathering of signatures on an initiative or referendum petition; or (ii) The adoption of a measure.

(b) Except for facilitating the actions described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the recognized student government of a community college or public university, or a member of the recognized student government while acting as a member, may not use mandatory student-initiated fees, mandatory enrollment fees, mandatory incidental fees or any public moneys to promote or oppose any political committee or promote or oppose the appointment, nomination or election of a person to a public office, the filing of or the gathering of signatures on an initiative, referendum or recall petition, the adoption of a measure or the recall of a public office holder. (6) Nothing in this section prohibits an employee of the legislative branch from explaining the vote of a member of the Legislative Assembly on: (a) An Act that has been referred to the people by law or petition under Article IV, section 1 (3), of the Oregon Constitution; (b) An Act for which a prospective referendum petition has been filed under ORS 250.045; or (c) A constitutional amendment or revision proposed under Article XVII, section 1 or 2, of the Oregon Constitution.

(1) No person shall cause to be written, printed, published, posted, communicated or circulated, including by electronic or telephonic means, any letter, circular, bill, placard, poster, photograph or other publication, or cause any advertisement to be placed in a publication, or singly or with others pay for any advertisement or circulate an advertisement by electronic or telephonic means, with knowledge or with reckless disregard that the letter, circular, bill, placard, poster, photograph, publication or advertisement contains a false statement of material fact relating to any candidate, political committee or measure. (2) As used in subsection (1) of this section, cause does not include the broadcast of an advertisement by a radio or television station or cable television company unless the advertisement is for: (a) The candidacy of the owner, licensee or operator of the station or company; or (b) A ballot measure of which a chief petitioner is the owner, licensee or operator of the station or company. (3) A candidate who knows of and consents to a publication or advertisement prohibited by this section with knowledge or with reckless disregard that it contains a false statement of material fact, violates this section regardless of whether the candidate has participated directly in the publication or advertisement. (4) There is a rebuttable presumption that a candidate knows of and consents to any publication or advertisement prohibited by this section caused by a political committee over which the candidate exercises any direction and control. (5) Any candidate or political committee aggrieved by a violation of this section shall have a right of action against the person alleged to have committed the violation. The aggrieved party may file the action in the circuit court for any county in this state in which a defendant resides or can be found or, if the defendant is a nonresident of this state, in the circuit court for any county in which the publication occurred. To prevail in such an action, the plaintiff must show by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant violated subsection (1) of this section. (6) A plaintiff who prevails in an action provided by subsection (5) of this section may recover economic and noneconomic damages, as defined in ORS 31.705, or $2,500, whichever is greater. The court may award such additional equitable relief as it considers necessary or proper. The equitable relief may include, but is not limited to, a requirement that a retraction of the false statement be disseminated in the manner directed by the court. Proof of entitlement to economic and noneconomic damages must be by a preponderance of evidence. The court shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees at trial and on appeal. (7) A political committee has standing to bring an action provided by subsection (5) of this section as plaintiff in its own name, if its purpose as evidenced by its preelection activities, solicitations and publications has been injured by the violation and if it has fully complied with the provisions of this chapter. In an action brought by a political committee as provided by subsection (5) of this section, the plaintiff may recover economic and noneconomic damages for all injury to the purpose of the committee as provided in subsection (6) of this section. (8) If a judgment is rendered in an action under this section against a defendant who has been nominated to public office or elected to a public office other than state Senator or state Representative, and it is established by clear and convincing evidence that the false statement was deliberately made or caused to be made by the defendant, the finder of fact shall determine whether the false statement reversed the outcome of the election. If the finder of fact finds by clear and convincing evidence that the false statement reversed the outcome of the election, the defendant shall be deprived of the nomination or election and the nomination or office shall be declared vacant. (9) An action under this section must be filed not later than the 30th day after the election relating to which a publication or advertisement in violation of this section was made. Proceedings on a complaint filed under this section shall have precedence over all other business on the docket. The courts shall proceed in a manner which will ensure that: (a) Final judgment on a complaint which relates to a primary election or nominating election is rendered before the 30th day before the general election; and (b) Final judgment on a complaint which relates to an election to an office is rendered before the term of that office begins. (10) The remedy provided by this section is the exclusive remedy for a violation of this section.",

The statement on the back of a return envelope shall be in bold print that is at least 36-point type. (B) The word UNOFFICIAL must be superimposed on the imitation ballot or sample ballot so that the word extends diagonally across the ballot from one margin of the text to the other.

(7) A person, except an elections official in performance of duties or another person providing assistance to an elector as described in ORS 254.445, may not ask a person at any place designated for the deposit of ballots under ORS 254.470 or at any location described in ORS 254.472 or 254.474 for whom that person intends to vote, or examine or attempt to examine the persons ballot. (8) An elections official, other than in the performance of duties, may not disclose to any person any information by which it can be ascertained for whom any elector has voted.

(10) An elector may not willfully leave at any place designated for the deposit of ballots under ORS 254.470 or at any location described in ORS 254.472 or 254.474 anything that will show how the electors ballot was marked.
