However, certain changes made by the federal Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514) and adopted by the amendments to ORS 316.007, 316.012, 317.010, 317.013 and 317.018 by sections 1, 2 and 31 to 33, chapter 293, Oregon Laws 1987, apply for federal tax purposes as follows: (a) To tax years beginning prior to January 1, 1987; (b) To transactions occurring before, on or after December 31, 1986, in tax years ending after that date; or (c) To transactions occurring prior to January 1, 1987, but with tax consequences for federal purposes only for tax years beginning after December 31, 1986. (3) The changes described in subsection (2)(a) of this section, if otherwise applicable for Oregon tax purposes, shall apply to and are specifically adopted for tax years beginning prior to January 1, 1987. (4) The changes described in subsection (2)(b) and (c) of this section if otherwise applicable for Oregon tax purposes, shall apply to and are specifically adopted for transactions occurring before, on or after December 31, 1986, in tax years ending after December 31, 1986, or beginning after December 31, 1986, whichever is applicable. (5) The changes described in subsections (3) and (4) of this section are exemplified by, but are specifically not limited to the following: (a) The amendments made by section 122 of the TRA (relating to charitable and employee achievement awards) which apply to prizes and awards granted after December 31, 1986. (b) The amendments by section 123 of the TRA (relating to scholarships and fellowships) which apply to tax years beginning after December 31, 1986, but only in the case of scholarships and fellowships granted after August 16, 1986.

However, if an election is made under section 203(a)(1)(B) of the TRA, that election shall be considered to be made for Oregon tax purposes. In addition, the transitional rules contained in sections 203 and 204 of the TRA shall apply for Oregon purposes to the extent they can be made applicable, in the same manner as for federal tax purposes. (d) Section 611 of the TRA (reducing the dividends received deduction for corporations) which applies to dividends received or accrued after December 31, 1986, in tax years ending after that date.

(6) If the TRA allows or requires an adjustment to the federal tax return filed for a tax year beginning prior to January 1, 1987, and such an adjustment is made, the adjustment (if adopted for Oregon tax purposes) shall also be made to the corresponding Oregon return notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, in the manner provided under ORS 314.135. (7) If certain transactions are grandfathered by the TRA or the changes in the federal law made by the TRA are otherwise made inapplicable to those transactions, the same treatment shall be given those transactions for Oregon tax purposes unless otherwise provided under ORS chapter 316, 317, 318 or other law governing the determination of Oregon personal income and Oregon corporate excise and income taxes.

The circumstances under which the adjustment provided in ORS 314.115 is authorized are as follows: (1) The determination requires the inclusion in gross income of an item that was erroneously included in the gross income of the taxpayer for another taxable year or in the gross income of a related taxpayer. (2) The determination allows a deduction or credit that was erroneously allowed to the taxpayer for another taxable year or to a related taxpayer. (3)(a) The determination requires the exclusion from gross income of an item included in a return filed by the taxpayer or with respect to which tax was paid and that was erroneously excluded or omitted from the gross income of the taxpayer for another taxable year, or from the gross income of a related taxpayer; or (b) The determination requires the exclusion from gross income of an item not included in a return filed by the taxpayer and with respect to which the tax was not paid but that is includable in the gross income of the taxpayer for another taxable year or in the gross income of a related taxpayer. (4) The determination disallows a deduction or credit that should have been allowed to, but was not allowed to, the taxpayer for another taxable year, or to a related taxpayer. (5) The determination allows or disallows any of the additional deductions allowable in computing the taxable income of estates or trusts, or requires or denies any of the inclusions in the computation of taxable income of beneficiaries, heirs or legatees, specified in sections 641 to 679 of the Internal Revenue Code, or corresponding provisions of subsequent internal revenue laws, and the correlative inclusion or deduction, as the case may be, has been erroneously excluded, omitted or included, or disallowed, omitted or allowed, as the case may be in respect of the related taxpayer. (6) The determination allows or disallows a deduction (including a credit) in computing the taxable income (or, as the case may be, net income, normal tax net income or surtax net income) of a corporation, and a correlative deduction or credit has been erroneously allowed, omitted or disallowed, as the case may be, in respect of a related taxpayer described in ORS 314.105 (2)(g). (7)(a) The determination determines the basis of property, and in respect of any transaction on which such basis depends, or in respect of any transaction that was erroneously treated as affecting such basis, there occurred, with respect to a taxpayer described in paragraph (b) of this subsection, any of the errors described in paragraph (c) of this subsection. (b) The taxpayer with respect to whom the erroneous treatment occurred must be: (A) The taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made; (B) A taxpayer who acquired title to the property in the transaction and from whom, mediately or immediately, the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made derived title; or (C) A taxpayer who had title to the property at the time of the transaction and from whom, mediately or immediately, the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made derived title, if the basis of the property in the hands of the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made is determined under section 1015(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. (c) With respect to a taxpayer described in paragraph (b) of this subsection, there was an erroneous inclusion in, or omission from, gross income, there was an erroneous recognition, or nonrecognition, of gain or loss, or there was an erroneous deduction of an item properly chargeable to capital account or an erroneous charge to capital account of an item properly deductible.",

(1) When a taxpayer ceases to exist or is no longer subject to the jurisdiction of this state (although subject to the courts of a state having comity or reciprocity with the State of Oregon), being indebted for taxes upon or measured by net income, the transferee of the money or property of the taxpayer shall be liable for any such tax or deficiency in tax, including penalties and interest, imposed by law on the taxpayer and accruing or accrued upon the date of transfer, to the extent of the amount of money or value of the property received by the transferee. Property received by the transferee shall be valued at the fair market value of said property at the time of transfer to the initial transferee by the taxpayer. (2) The amount for which a transferee of the property of a taxpayer is liable in respect of any such tax or deficiency in tax, including penalties and interest, whether shown on the return of the taxpayer or determined as a deficiency in the tax, shall be assessed against such transferee and collected and paid in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as would apply to the taxpayer had the taxpayer or it continued subject to the jurisdiction of this state, except as provided in this section. (3) As used in this section, the term transferee means one not a bona fide purchaser for value and includes an heir, legatee, devisee, distributee of an estate of a deceased person, the shareholder of a dissolved corporation, the assignee or donee of an insolvent person, the successor of a corporation which is a party to a corporate reorganization, and persons acting on behalf of such transferees in a fiduciary capacity. (4) The period of limitation for assessment of any such liability of a transferee shall be as follows: (a) In the case of the liability of an initial transferee of the property of the taxpayer, within one year after the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment against the taxpayer. (b) In the case of the liability of a transferee of a transferee of the property of the taxpayer, within one year after the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment against the preceding transferee, but not more than three years after the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment against the taxpayer. (c) If, before the expiration of the period of limitation for the assessment of the liability of the transferee, as set forth in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, a court proceeding for the collection of the tax or liability in respect thereof has been filed against the taxpayer or last preceding transferee, then the period of limitation for assessment of the liability of the transferee shall expire one year after final judgment has been rendered in the court proceedings. (d) If, before the expiration of the time prescribed in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this subsection for the assessment of the liability, both the Department of Revenue and the transferee have consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the liability may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period of extension agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be further extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period of extension previously agreed upon. (5) For the purposes of this section, if the taxpayer is deceased, or in the case of a corporation, has terminated its existence, the period of limitation for assessment against the taxpayer shall be the period which would be in effect had death or termination of existence not occurred. (6) In the absence of notice to the Department of Revenue of the existence of a fiduciary relationship, notice of liability enforceable under this section in respect of a tax or deficiency in tax, including penalties and interest thereon, imposed upon or measured by net income, if mailed to the last-known address of the person subject to the liability, shall be sufficient for the purposes of this section even if such person is deceased, or is under a legal disability, or, in the case of a corporation, has terminated its existence.",

      "text": "(4) An audited partnership may make an election to pay at the partnership level. Subject to the limitations in subsection (5) of this section, an audited partnership making an election under this subsection shall: (a) Not later than 180 days after the date of the federal notice of final partnership adjustment, file with the department a completed adjustments report, including partner information and any other information required by the department, and notify the department that it is making the election under this subsection; and (b) Not later than 270 days after the date of the federal notice of final partnership adjustment, pay an amount, in lieu of taxes owed by the direct and indirect partners of the partnership, to be determined as follows: (A) For the total distributive shares of adjustments made to direct partners that are corporate partners, apportion and allocate any adjustments as provided under this chapter and multiply the resulting amount by the highest marginal tax rate applicable to taxpayers subject to the tax imposed under ORS chapter 317 or 318 for the reviewed year; (B) For the total distributive shares of adjustments made to direct partners that are nonresident partners subject to tax under ORS chapter 316, determine the amount of any adjustment that is income from Oregon sources under ORS chapter 316 and multiply the resulting amount by the highest marginal tax rate applicable to taxpayers for the tax year under ORS chapter 316; (C) For the total distributive shares of adjustments made to tiered partners: (i) Determine the amount of any adjustment that is of a type that would be subject to sourcing to Oregon by a nonresident partner under ORS chapter 316 and determine the portion of this amount that would be sourced to Oregon; (ii) Determine the amount of any adjustment that is of a type that would not be subject to sourcing to Oregon by a nonresident partner under ORS chapter 316; (iii) Determine the portion of the amount in sub-subparagraph (ii) of this subparagraph that can be established, as prescribed by the department by rule, to be properly allocable to indirect partners that are nonresident partners or other partners not subject to tax on the adjustments; and (iv) Multiply the total of the amounts in sub-subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, reduced by the amount determined in sub-subparagraph (iii) of this subparagraph, by the highest marginal tax rate under ORS chapter 316; (D) For the total distributive shares of adjustments made to direct partners that are resident partners, multiply the amount of the adjustments by the highest marginal tax rate under ORS chapter 316; and (E) Add the amounts determined in subparagraphs (A) to (D) of this paragraph and any interest and penalty as provided in ORS 305.220 or 314.400. (5) Adjustments subject to the election in subsection (4) of this section do not include: (a) The distributive share of adjustments that under this chapter or ORS chapter 317 or 318 must be included in the apportionable income of any direct partner that is a corporate partner unless the corporate partner states in writing to the partnership representative that its distributive share of the adjustments is not required to be included in its apportionable income; (b) The distributive share of adjustments that under this chapter or ORS chapter 317 or 318 must be included in the apportionable income of any indirect partner that is a corporate partner, provided that the audited partnership can reasonably determine this; (c) The distributive share of adjustments made to a direct partner that is exempt from tax under ORS 316.277 or 317.080, other than any distributive share that is unrelated business taxable income of the partner; or (d) Any adjustments arising from an administrative adjustment request. (6) For purposes of subsection (5) of this section, a corporate partners distributive share is presumed to be included in the partners own apportionable income unless the partner provides the statement described in subsection (5)(a) of this section to the partnership representative. (7)(a) An audited partnership that makes an election under subsection (4) of this section consents to be subject to the administrative provisions of this chapter and ORS chapter 305. (b) The department may adopt rules to prevent double taxation or double deduction of any amount included in the computation of income under this section. (8) The direct and indirect partners of an audited partnership that are tiered partners and all partners of those tiered partners that are subject to tax imposed under ORS chapter 316, 317 or 318 are subject to the reporting and payment requirements of subsection (3) of this section. The tiered partners are entitled to make the elections provided in subsection (4) of this section. The tiered partners or their partners shall make the required reports and payments not later than 90 days after the time for filing and furnishing statements to tiered partners and their partners as established under section 6226 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. The department may adopt rules to establish procedures and interim time periods for the reports and payments required by tiered partners and their partners and for making the elections under subsection (4) of this section. (9)(a) The department may adopt rules allowing an extension of time for an audited partnership and its tiered partners or direct partners to file reports of adjustments required under this section. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, the tax shall be paid to the department on the date fixed by this section without regard to extensions. (c) Any extension granted under this section extends the final date prescribed by law for assessing any additional tax arising from the adjustments. (10)(a) An election made pursuant to subsection (4) of this section is irrevocable. (b) If reported properly and paid by the audited partnership or tiered partner, the amount determined in subsection (4)(b) of this section shall be treated as paid in lieu of taxes owed by its direct and indirect partners, to the extent applicable, on the same adjustments. Direct partners or indirect partners may not take any deduction or credit for the amount or claim a refund of the amount. (c) Nothing in this subsection precludes a direct partner that is a resident partner or nonresident partner from claiming a credit for any amounts paid by the audited partnership or tiered partner on the direct partners behalf to another state or local tax jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of ORS 316.082 or 316.131. (11) Nothing in this section prevents the department from assessing direct partners or indirect partners for taxes owed, using the best information available, in the event that a partnership or tiered partner fails to timely make any report or payment required by this section for any reason, or from collecting from direct partners or indirect partners.",

(B) The cost-of-living adjustment for a calendar year is the percentage by which the monthly averaged U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for the 12 consecutive months ending August 31 of the prior calendar year exceeds the monthly averaged index for the period beginning September 1, 2015, and ending August 31, 2016. (C) As used in this paragraph, U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index means the U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (All Items) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. (D) If any adjustment determined under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph is not a multiple of $50, the adjustment shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $50. (E) The adjustment shall apply to all tax years beginning in the calendar year for which the adjustment is made. (3) In the case of any item attributable to an abusive tax shelter: (a) No reduction of the amount of the understatement shall be made with regard to that item regardless of the existence of substantial authority for the treatment of the item by the taxpayer. (b) No reduction of the amount of the understatement shall be made with regard to that item regardless of the disclosure of the facts affecting the tax treatment of the item unless, in addition to the disclosure, the taxpayer reasonably believed that the tax treatment of the item was more likely than not the proper treatment. (4) As used in this section: (a) Abusive tax shelter means any partnership, corporation or other organization or entity, any investment plan or arrangement or any other plan or arrangement, which has as its principal purpose the evasion or improper avoidance of federal or state income tax. Abusive tax shelter includes any investment or activity in connection with which tax benefits derived by investors are not clearly intended under the tax laws or any investment or activity that involves little or no economic reality, making use of unrealistic allocations of income or expenses, inflated appraisals of asset values, losses substantially in excess of investment, mismatching of income and expenses, financing techniques that do not conform to standard commercial business practice or mischaracterization of the substance of the investment or activity. (b) Understatement means the excess of the amount of the net tax required to be shown on the return for the tax year over the amount of the net tax shown on the return, reduced by any portion of the understatement that is attributable to: (A) The tax treatment of any item by the taxpayer if there is or was substantial authority for such treatment; or (B) Any item with respect to which: (i) The relevant facts affecting the items tax treatment are adequately disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the return; and (ii) There is a reasonable basis for the tax treatment of the item by the taxpayer. (5) The penalty imposed under this section is in addition to any other penalty imposed by law. A penalty imposed under this section shall be treated for all purposes as an additional deficiency subject to the provisions of ORS 305.265, but shall not bear interest. (6) The department may waive all or any part of the penalty imposed under this section on a showing by the taxpayer that there was reasonable cause for the understatement, or any portion thereof, and that the taxpayer acted in good faith.",

(1) At any time within three years after the return was filed, the Department of Revenue may give notice of deficiency as prescribed in ORS 305.265. (2) If the department finds that gross income equal to 25 percent or more of the gross income reported has been omitted from the taxpayers return, notice of the deficiency may be given at any time within five years after the return was filed. (3) If the department finds that a return reports or reflects the use of a listed transaction, as defined in ORS 314.307, and that use of that listed transaction results in a deficiency in tax paid, notice of that deficiency may be given at any time within nine years after the return was filed. (4)(a) The limitations to the giving of notice of a deficiency provided in this section do not apply to a deficiency resulting from false or fraudulent returns, or in cases where no return has been filed. (b)(A) If the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or other authorized officer of the federal government or an authorized officer of another states taxing authority makes a change or correction as described in ORS 314.380 (2)(a)(A) and, as a result of the change or correction, an assessment of tax or issuance of a refund is permitted under any provision of the Internal Revenue Code or applicable law of the other state, or pursuant to an agreement between the taxpayer and the federal or other state taxing authority that extends the period in which an assessment of federal or other state tax may be made, then notice of a deficiency under any Oregon law imposing tax upon or measured by income for the corresponding tax year may be mailed within two years after the department is notified by the taxpayer or the commissioner or other tax official of the correction, or within the applicable period prescribed in subsections (1) to (3) of this section, whichever period expires later. (B) A notice of deficiency mailed pursuant to this paragraph may assert any adjustment necessary to arrive at the correct amount of Oregon taxable income and Oregon tax liability for the tax year for which the federal or other state change or correction is made. (c) If the taxpayer files an original or amended federal or other state return as described in ORS 314.380 (2)(a)(B), the department may reduce any claim for refund as a result of a change in Oregon tax liability related to the original or amended federal or other state return, but may not give notice of a deficiency for an adjustment to Oregon tax liability following the expiration of the applicable period prescribed in subsections (1) to (3) of this section and paragraph (a) of this subsection. (5) The tax deficiency must be assessed and notice of tax assessment mailed to the taxpayer or authorized representative, who is authorized in writing, within one year from the date of the notice of deficiency unless an extension of time is agreed upon as prescribed in subsection (7) of this section. (6) Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, the period for the assessment of any deficiency attributable to any part of the gain realized upon the sale or exchange of the taxpayers principal residence, as provided in section 1034 of the Internal Revenue Code (as in effect prior to the repeal of section 1034 of the Internal Revenue Code by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-34)), does not expire prior to the expiration of three years from the date the department is notified by the taxpayer of: (a) The cost of purchasing the new residence which the taxpayer claims results in nonrecognition of any part of such gain; (b) The taxpayers intention not to purchase a new residence; or (c) A failure to purchase a new residence within the period prescribed in section 1034 of the Internal Revenue Code (as in effect prior to the repeal of section 1034 of the Internal Revenue Code by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-34)). (7) If, prior to the expiration of any period of time prescribed in this section for giving of notice of deficiency or of assessment, the department and the taxpayer consent in writing to the notice of deficiency being mailed or deficiency being assessed after the expiration of such prescribed period, notice of such deficiency may be mailed or the deficiency assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period agreed upon.

(f) The amount of the refund, exclusive of interest on the refund, may not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the period preceding the filing of the claim or, if no claim is filed, then during the period preceding the allowance of the refund during which a claim might have been filed. Where there has been an overpayment of any tax imposed, the amount of the overpayment and interest on the overpayment shall be credited against any tax, penalty or interest then due from the taxpayer, and only the balance shall be refunded. (g) Except as provided in ORS 305.265 (12), if, pursuant to a notice of deficiency or assessment, the taxpayer pays the amount specified in the notice, or any part thereof, and if, upon appeal, the Oregon Tax Court or the Oregon Supreme Court orders that all or any part of the deficiency amount specified in the notice and paid by the taxpayer be refunded, the amount so ordered to be refunded shall bear interest at the rate established for refunds in ORS 305.220. Interest shall be computed from the date of payment to the department. Nothing in this subsection shall require that interest be paid upon any amount for any period for which interest upon the same amount for the same period is required to be paid under ORS 305.419. (3)(a) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in ORS 305.265 or 305.270 or subsection (1) or (2) of this section, if, prior to the expiration of the period prescribed in subsection (2) of this section, the department and the taxpayer consent in writing to the refund of tax after the expiration of the period prescribed: (A) The department shall make the refund prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon; and (B) The department may not make or allow a refund after the expiration of the period agreed upon unless a claim for refund is filed by the taxpayer before the expiration of the period agreed upon in compliance with the manner prescribed by the department. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. (b) The department may consent to extend the period during which a refund may be made only if the taxpayer has consented to the assessment of additional tax, if additional taxes are determined upon audit, after the expiration of the applicable period prescribed in ORS 314.410 (1) to (3). (4)(a) If the claim for credit or refund relates to an overpayment on account of the deductibility by the taxpayer, or by a partnership, of the worthlessness of a share of stock in a corporation, of the right to subscribe for or to receive a share of stock in a corporation, or of a debt, in lieu of the three-year period of limitation prescribed in subsection (2) of this section, the period shall be seven years from the date prescribed by law for the filing of the return for the year with respect to which the claim is made. (b) If the claim described in paragraph (a) of this subsection is made after the expiration of the three-year period prescribed in subsection (2) of this section, the department may not allow interest with respect to any credit or refund determined to be due upon the claim for the period beginning at the close of the three-year period prescribed in subsection (2) of this section and ending at the expiration of six months after the date on which the claim is filed. (5)(a) If the claim for credit or refund relates to an overpayment attributable to a net operating loss carryback or a net capital loss carryback, in lieu of the three-year period of limitation prescribed in subsection (2) of this section, the period shall be the period that ends three years after the time prescribed by law for filing the return (including extensions) for the taxable year of the net operating loss or net capital loss that results in such carryback. In the case of such a claim, the amount of the credit or refund may exceed the portion of the tax paid within the period provided in subsection (1), (2) or (3) of this section, whichever is applicable, to the extent of the amount of the overpayment attributable to the carryback. If the allowance of a credit or refund of an overpayment of tax attributable to a net operating loss carryback or a net capital loss carryback is otherwise prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law other than ORS 305.150, relating to closing agreements, the credit or refund may be allowed or made if the claim for credit or refund is filed within the period provided in this subsection. To the extent that the carryback was not an issue in any proceeding in which the determination of a court, including the Oregon Tax Court, has become final, the claimed credit or refund applicable to that carryback may be allowed or made under this subsection. (b) For purposes of subsection (1) or (2) of this section, if any overpayment of tax results from a carryback of a net operating loss or net capital loss, the overpayment shall be deemed not to have been made prior to the later of: (A) The due date of the return for the taxable year in which such net operating loss or net capital loss arises; (B) The date the return for the year in which the net operating loss or net capital loss arises is filed; or (C) The date of filing of the return for the year to which the net operating loss or net capital loss is carried back. (6) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in ORS 305.265 or 305.270 or this section, if the taxpayer has agreed with the United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue for an extension, or a renewal of an extension, of the period for proposing and assessing deficiencies in federal income tax for any year, the period within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed or credit or refund allowed or made if no claim is filed shall be the period provided within subsections (1) to (5) of this section or six months after the date of the expiration of the agreed period for assessing deficiency in federal income tax, whichever period expires later. (7) If a joint return is filed, the department may make separate refunds at the request of either spouse. The separate refunds shall bear the same proportion to the total refund as the adjusted gross income of each spouse bears to the adjusted gross income of both spouses, or as otherwise determined by the department. (8) If a taxpayer entitled to a refund under subsection (1) of this section dies, the department may issue a draft for payment of such refund under the terms and conditions set out in ORS 293.490 to 293.500 exercising the same powers and subject to the same restrictions pursuant to which the State Treasurer is authorized to pay the amounts of warrants, checks or orders under those statutes.",

For purposes of this paragraph: (A) The sale of goods shipped from a public warehouse is not considered to take place in this state if: (i) The taxpayers only activity in Oregon is the storage of the goods in the public warehouse prior to shipment; or (ii) The taxpayers only activities in Oregon are the storage of the goods in the public warehouse prior to shipment and the presence of employees within this state solely for purposes of soliciting sales of the taxpayers products; and (B) Taxpayer means a taxpayer as defined in section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code, an affiliate of the person storing goods in a public warehouse or a person that is related under section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code to the person storing goods in a public warehouse. (3) Subsection (2)(b) of this section does not apply to sales of tangible personal property if: (a) The sales are included in the numerator of a formula used to apportion income to another state of the United States, a foreign country or the District of Columbia; and (b) The other state, a foreign country or the District of Columbia has imposed a tax on or measured by the apportioned income. (4) Sales, other than sales of tangible personal property, are in this state if the taxpayers market for sales is in this state, as determined under ORS 314.666. (5) Where the sales apportionment factor is determined by administrative rule pursuant to ORS 317.660 or other law, the Department of Revenue shall adopt rules that are consistent with the determination of the sales factor under this section. (6) The department may determine that a warehouse that meets the definition of public warehouse under this section may not be treated as a public warehouse if the warehouse is being used primarily for tax avoidance purposes or if transactions related to the use of the warehouse are primarily for tax avoidance purposes. (7) As used in this section, public warehouse: (a) Means a warehouse owned or operated by a person that does not own the goods stored in the warehouse; and (b) Does not include a warehouse that is owned by a person that is related to the person that owns goods that are stored in the warehouse, as determined under section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code, or an affiliate of the person that owns goods that are stored in the warehouse.",

(1) The Legislative Assembly finds that: (a) The State of Oregon has a compelling interest in promoting and stimulating economic development within this state to better provide for the welfare of its residents, in encouraging businesses to make significant capital investments within this state and in creating certainty in the apportionment of income for purposes of income and corporate excise taxation that achieves these ends; (b) Use of the single sales factor method to apportion income promotes an economic development climate that encourages businesses to locate and remain within this state, encourages existing Oregon businesses to expand their operations in Oregon and creates incentives for businesses to make significant capital investments within this state; (c) Qualifying investments will create significant, long-term economic benefits and serve as the catalyst for additional economic expansion within the State of Oregon; (d) It is in the interest of the State of Oregon to authorize the Governor, in consultation with the Director of the Oregon Business Development Department and the Director of the Department of Revenue, to enter into qualifying investment contracts for purposes of stimulating economic development through qualifying investments; (e) In consideration for making qualifying investments, taxpayers should be entitled to rely on the continued application of the single sales factor method to apportion their income for tax purposes; (f) Factors to be considered in determining the duration of the term of a qualifying investment contract should include, without limitation, the number of new employees to be added to the Oregon workforce of the taxpayer when the qualifying investment is complete, the duration and compensation of the new jobs created, other economic development incentives received by the company and the extent to which the qualifying investment will create employment opportunities in rural Oregon; and (g) The State of Oregon has a compelling interest in contractually guaranteeing to taxpayers making qualifying investments that such taxpayers may rely on the single sales factor method as the applicable method to determine the portion of apportionable income subject to income or corporate excise tax in the State of Oregon. (2) The purposes of ORS 314.668 to 314.673 are: (a) To promote and stimulate economic development by creating an incentive for qualifying investments; (b) To authorize the Governor, in consultation with the Director of the Oregon Business Development Department and the Director of the Department of Revenue, to enter into qualifying investment contracts on behalf of this state; and (c) To ratify any qualifying investment contracts entered into on or after December 14, 2012. (3) The intent of the Legislative Assembly is for ORS 314.668 to 314.673 to establish a contractually binding obligation under which taxpayers that execute qualifying investment contracts with the State of Oregon may rely on the single sales factor method of apportionment to apportion their apportionable income for each tax year of the taxpayer that ends during the term of the qualifying investment contract.",

(1) Every partnership having a resident partner or having any income derived from sources in this state, determined in accordance with the applicable rules as in the case of a nonresident individual, shall make a return for the taxable year setting forth all items of income, gain, loss and deduction, and the names and addresses of the individuals (whether residents or nonresidents) who would be entitled to share in the net income, if distributed, and the amount of the distributive share of each individual, and any other pertinent information the Department of Revenue may prescribe by regulations and instructions. The return shall be filed on or before the due date of the corresponding federal return for the tax year as prescribed under the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. For purposes of this section, taxable year means a year or period which would be a taxable year of the partnership if it were subject to tax under ORS chapter 316. (2) If a partnership transacting business in this state is required to make a return under subsection (1) of this section and fails to file the return or files a return which fails to show the information required under subsection (1) of this section, the Department of Revenue shall assess a penalty against the partnership in the amount specified in subsection (3) of this section for each month or part of a month during which the failure continues. (3) The amount of the penalty imposed under subsection (2) of this section shall be determined by the department by rule. However, the amount of the penalty imposed for each month may not exceed the product of $50 multiplied by the number of persons who were partners in the partnership during any part of the taxable year, and the total amount of the penalty may not exceed five times the monthly penalty. (4) The penalty imposed under this section is in addition to any other penalty provided by law. Any partnership against which a penalty is assessed under this section may appeal to the tax court as provided in ORS 305.404 to 305.560. If the penalty is not paid within 10 days after the order of the tax court becomes final, the department may record the order and collect the amount assessed in the same manner as income tax deficiencies are recorded and collected under ORS",
