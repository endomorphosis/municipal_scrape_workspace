(b) The director may revoke or restrict the ongoing authority of the institution to hold stock in the corporation or membership interests in the limited liability company if the condition of the institution substantially deteriorates or if the insurance activities are adversely affecting the institution. (c) For each calendar year during which an institution owns all or part of a corporation, or a limited liability company, that is licensed as an insurance producer as required by ORS 744.053, the institution shall file a written report with the director. The report must be filed not later than March 31 of the following year and shall disclose the insurance activities of the corporation or the limited liability company. The director shall establish the required contents of the report by rule. The reports filed with the director under this paragraph must be available for public inspection in the directors office. (d) The corporation or limited liability company may not in any manner use customer information that the institution obtained from another insurance producer to promote, develop or solicit insurance business for the corporation or the limited liability company unless the other insurance producer consents to such use of the customer information. (e) The corporation or the limited liability company is subject to the limitations that apply to depository institutions under ORS 746.213 to 746.219.

(2) If a borrower repays before maturity a loan that an Oregon commercial bank made, the Oregon commercial bank shall refund or credit to the borrower as provided in this subsection the unearned portion of the charges, if any. The amount of the refund may not be less than the total interest contracted for to maturity, less the greater of: (a) Ten percent of the amount financed, or $75, whichever is less; or (b) The interest earned to the installment due date nearest the date of prepayment, computed by applying the simple interest rate of the loan to the actual principal balances outstanding, for the periods of time the balances were actually outstanding. For purposes of computations under this paragraph, the installment due date that precedes the date of prepayment is nearest if prepayment occurs 15 days or less after that installment date. If prepayment occurs more than 15 days after the preceding installment due date, the next succeeding installment due date is nearest the date of prepayment. In determining the simple interest rate, an Oregon commercial bank may apply to the scheduled payments the actuarial method, by which each scheduled payment is applied first to accrued and unpaid interest and any amount remaining is applied to reduce the principal balance. (3) Any installment of an installment loan or payment under an open-end credit arrangement that the borrower does not pay when due continues to bear interest until paid. In addition, if the borrower does not pay the installment or payment when due, the installment or payment may bear a late charge in an amount to which the Oregon commercial bank and the borrower agree. Except for loans secured by real property, an Oregon commercial bank may impose a late charge only if: (a) The Oregon commercial bank does not receive the installment or payment within 10 days after the due date or, if the open-end credit arrangement is a credit card account, the Oregon commercial bank does not receive the payment on or before the due date; (b) The loan agreement or open-end credit arrangement provides for a late charge upon delinquent installments or payments; and (c) The Oregon commercial bank provides a monthly billing, coupon or notice that discloses the date on which installments or payments are due and states that the Oregon commercial bank may impose a late charge if: (A) The Oregon commercial bank does not receive payment within 10 days after the date on which the installment or payment is due; or (B) In the case of an open-end credit arrangement that is a credit card account, the Oregon commercial bank does not receive payment on or before the date on which the payment is due. If the Oregon commercial bank and the borrower have provided in the note or other written loan agreement that the borrower will make payments on the loan by means of automatic deductions from a deposit account that the borrower maintains, this paragraph does not require the Oregon commercial bank to provide the borrower with a monthly billing, coupon or notice on any occasion in which insufficient funds are in the borrowers account to cover the amount of a loan payment on the date the loan payment becomes due and within the periods described in paragraph (a) of this subsection.",

      "text": "Disposition of deposit on death of depositor. (1) On the death of a depositor of an insured institution, if the deposit is $25,000 or less, the insured institution, after receiving an affidavit as provided in subsection (3) of this section from a person that claims the deposit, or a declaration from the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority as provided in subsection (4) of this section, may pay the moneys on deposit to the credit of the deceased depositor, in the following order of priority, to: (a) The surviving spouse at the surviving spouses demand at any time after the depositors death; (b) The Oregon Health Authority or the Department of Human Services, if the authority or the department demands the payment not less than 46 days and no more than 75 days after the death of the depositor if the depositor does not have a surviving spouse and if the authority or department has a preferred claim under ORS 411.708, 411.795 or 416.350; (c) The depositors surviving children 18 years of age or older, if the depositor does not have a surviving spouse and the authority and department do not have a claim; (d) The depositors surviving parent, if the depositor does not have a surviving spouse or surviving child 18 years of age or older and if the authority and department do not have a claim; (e) The depositors surviving brothers and sisters 18 years of age or older, if the depositor does not have a surviving spouse, surviving child 18 years of age or older or surviving parent and the authority and department do not have a claim; or (f) Any other surviving heir of the depositor, if there is no surviving spouse, authority claim, department claim, surviving child 18 years of age or older, surviving parent or surviving brothers or sisters 18 years of age or older. (2)(a) An insured institution may not pay moneys on deposit under subsection (1)(c) to (f) of this section earlier than 46 days after the death of the depositor. (b) An insured institution may not pay moneys on deposit under subsection (1)(c) to (f) of this section earlier than 76 days after the death of the depositor unless the financial institution obtains prior verbal or written authorization from the Oregon Health Authority or its designated representative and the Department of Human Services or its designated representative. (3) An affidavit or declaration submitted under this section must: (a) State where and when the depositor died; (b) State that the total deposits of the deceased depositor in all financial institutions in Oregon do not exceed $25,000; (c) Show the relationship of the affiant or declarant to the deceased depositor; and (d) Embody a promise to pay the expenses of last sickness, funeral expenses and just debts of the deceased depositor out of the deposit to the full extent of the deposit if necessary, in the order of priority prescribed by ORS 115.125, and to distribute any remaining moneys to the persons that are entitled to the moneys by law. (4) An insured institution shall accept from the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority, without additional requirements, a declaration under penalty of perjury meeting the requirements of subsection (3) of this section, provided that the declaration is submitted no earlier than 46 days after the death of the depositor and no later than 76 days after the death of the depositor. A declaration submitted under this section must be signed by the declarant and must include the following sentence immediately above the signature line of the declarant: I hereby declare under penalty of perjury that I am authorized by the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority to make this declaration, that the above statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that I understand that it is subject to penalty for perjury. (5) In the event the depositor died intestate without known heirs, an estate administrator of the State Treasurer appointed under ORS 113.235 is the affiant and shall receive the moneys for deposit into the Unclaimed Property and Estates Fund as escheated property and subject to claims under ORS 116.253. (6) The insured institution shall determine the relationship of the affiant or declarant to the deceased depositor, but paying the moneys in good faith to the affiant or declarant discharges and releases the insured institution from any liability or responsibility for the transfer in the same manner and with the same effect as if the insured institution transferred, delivered or paid the moneys to a personal representative of the estate of the deceased depositor. (7) A probate proceeding is not necessary to establish the right of the surviving spouse, Oregon Health Authority, Department of Human Services, surviving child, surviving parent, surviving brothers and sisters or an estate administrator of the State Treasurer to withdraw the deposits after filing the affidavit or declaration. If a personal representative is appointed in an estate where a withdrawal of deposits was made under this section, the person that withdraws the deposits shall account for the deposits to the personal representative. (8) If an insured institution transfers moneys under subsection (1) of this section, the insured institution may require the transferee to furnish the insured institution with a written indemnity agreement that indemnifies the insured institution against loss for moneys the insured institution transferred to the extent of the amount of the deposit. (9)(a) Moneys disbursed to the Department of Human Services under subsection (1) of this section may be made payable only to the department. (b) Moneys disbursed to the Oregon Health Authority under subsection (1) of this section may be made payable only to the authority. (10) This section is subject to the rights of other parties in the account under ORS",

The right of survivorship continues between the surviving parties. (2) If the account is a P.O.D. account: (a) On the death of one of two or more original parties, subsection (1) of this section governs the rights to any sums that remain on deposit. (b) On the death of the sole original party or the survivor of two or more original parties, any sums that remain on deposit belong to the P.O.D. payee or payees, if a P.O.D. payee or payees survive, or to the remaining P.O.D. payee or payees if one or more P.O.D. payees die before the original party.

(b) On the death of the sole trustee or the survivor of two or more trustees, any sums that remain on deposit belong to the person or persons named as beneficiaries, if a beneficiary or beneficiaries survive, or to the remaining beneficiary if one or more beneficiaries die before the trustee, unless clear and convincing evidence exists of a contrary intent.

(7) An insured institution is not liable, with respect to sums that remain on deposit at the death of a party to a joint account, for distributing the sums to a surviving party or parties in accordance with the account agreement unless, before distributing the sums to a surviving party or parties: (a) The insured institution has received notice in writing of an adverse claim under ORS 708A.435; and (b) The adverse claimant proceeds as required under ORS 708A.435.",

(1) This section applies to the safe deposit box of any person who is the sole lessee or last surviving lessee of the box and who has died. (2) Subject to ORS 114.537, upon being furnished with a certified copy of the decedents death record or other evidence of death satisfactory to the Oregon operating institution, the Oregon operating institution within which the box is located shall cause or permit the box to be opened, and the contents of the box examined, at the request of an individual who furnishes an affidavit stating: (a) That the individual believes the box may contain the will of the decedent, a trust instrument creating a trust of which the decedent was a trustor or a trustee at the time of the decedents death, documents pertaining to the disposition of the remains of the decedent, documents pertaining to property of the estate of the decedent or property of the estate of the decedent; and (b) That the individual is an interested person and wishes to open the box to conduct a will search or trust instrument search, obtain documents relating to the disposition of the decedents remains, inventory the contents of the box or remove property of the estate of the decedent pursuant to a simple estate affidavit filed under ORS 114.515. (3) For the purpose of this section, interested person means any of the following: (a) A person named as personal representative of the decedent in a purported will of the decedent; (b) The surviving spouse or any heir of the decedent; (c) A person who was serving as the court-appointed guardian or conservator of the decedent or as trustee for the decedent immediately prior to the decedents death; (d) A person named as successor trustee in a purported trust instrument creating a trust of which the decedent was a trustor or a trustee at the time of the decedents death; (e) A person designated by the decedent in a writing that is acceptable to the Oregon operating institution and is filed with it prior to the decedents death; (f) A person who immediately prior to the death of the decedent had the right of access to the box as an agent of the decedent under a durable power of attorney; (g) If there are no heirs of the decedent, an estate administrator of the State Treasurer appointed under ORS 113.235; or (h) A person who is authorized to file a simple estate affidavit under ORS 114.515. (4) If the box is opened for the purpose of conducting a will search, the Oregon operating institution shall remove any document that appears to be a will, make a true and correct copy of it and deliver the original will to a person designated in the will to serve as the decedents personal representative, or if no such person is designated or the Oregon operating institution cannot, despite reasonable efforts, determine the whereabouts of such person, the Oregon operating institution shall retain the will or deliver it to a court having jurisdiction of the estate of the decedent. A copy of the will shall be retained in the box. At the request of the interested person, a copy of the will, together with copies of any documents pertaining to the disposition of the remains of the decedent, may be given to the interested person. (5) If the box is opened for the purpose of conducting a trust instrument search, the Oregon operating institution shall remove any document that appears to be a trust instrument creating a trust of which the decedent was a trustor or trustee at the time of the decedents death, make a true and correct copy of it and deliver the original trust instrument to a person designated in the trust instrument to serve as the successor trustee on the death of the decedent. If no such person is designated or the Oregon operating institution cannot, despite reasonable efforts, determine the whereabouts of such person, the Oregon operating institution shall retain the trust instrument. A copy of the trust instrument shall be retained in the box. At the request of any interested person, a copy of the trust instrument may be given to the interested person. (6) If the box is opened for the purpose of obtaining documents pertaining to the disposition of the decedents remains, the Oregon operating institution shall comply with subsection (4) or (5) of this section with respect to any will or trust instrument of the decedent found in the box, and may in its discretion either: (a) Make and retain in the box a copy of any documents pertaining to the disposition of the remains of the decedent and tender the original documents to the interested person; or (b) Provide a copy of any documents pertaining to the disposition of the remains of the decedent to the interested person and retain the original documents in the box. (7) If the box is opened for the purpose of making an inventory of its contents, the Oregon operating institution shall comply with subsection (4) or (5) of this section with respect to any will or trust instrument of the decedent that is found in the box, and shall cause the inventory to be made. The inventory must be attested to by a representative of the Oregon operating institution and may be attested to by the interested person, if the interested person is present when the inventory is made. The Oregon operating institution shall retain the original inventory in the box, and shall furnish a copy of the inventory to the interested person upon request. (8) If the interested person is an affiant of a simple estate affidavit filed under ORS 114.515 and delivers a certified copy of the affidavit in the manner provided by ORS 114.535, the Oregon operating institution shall provide to the affiant access to the decedents property. The Oregon operating institution shall comply with subsection (4) or (5) of this section if a will or trust instrument of the decedent is found in the box. Subject to ORS 114.537, the Oregon operating institution shall allow the affiant to take possession of the personal property in the box. (9) The Oregon operating institution may presume the truth of any statement contained in the affidavit required to be furnished under this section or ORS 114.535, and when acting in reliance upon such an affidavit, the Oregon operating institution is discharged as if it had dealt with the personal representative of the decedent. The Oregon operating institution is not responsible for the adequacy of the description of any property included in an inventory of the contents of a box, or for the conversion of the property in connection with actions performed under this section, except for conversion by intentional acts of the Oregon operating institution or its employees, directors, officers or agents. If the Oregon operating institution is not satisfied that the requirements of this section have been satisfied, the Oregon operating institution may decline to open the box. (10) If the interested person or affiant does not furnish the key needed to open the box, and the Oregon operating institution must incur expense in gaining entry to the box, the Oregon operating institution may require that the interested person or affiant pay the expense of opening the box. (11) Any examination of the contents of a box under this section shall be conducted in the presence of at least one employee of the Oregon operating institution.",
