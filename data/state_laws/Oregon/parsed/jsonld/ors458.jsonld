Purposes that the fiduciary organization may approve are: (a) The acquisition of post-secondary education or job training. (b) If the account holder has established the account for the benefit of a household member who is under the age of 18 years, the payment of extracurricular nontuition expenses designed to prepare the member for post-secondary education or job training. (c) If the account holder has established a savings network account for higher education under ORS 178.300 to 178.360 on behalf of a designated beneficiary, the funding of qualified higher education expenses as defined in ORS 178.300 by one or more deposits into a savings network account for higher education on behalf of the same designated beneficiary.

In addition to payment on the purchase price of the residence, account moneys may be used to pay any usual or reasonable settlement, financing or other closing costs. The account holder must not have owned or held any interest in a residence during the three years prior to making the purchase. However, this three-year period shall not apply to displaced homemakers, individuals who have lost home ownership as a result of divorce or owners of manufactured homes. (e) The rental of a primary residence when housing stability is essential to achieve state policy goals. Account moneys may be used for security deposits, first and last months rent, application fees and other expenses necessary to move into the primary residence, as specified in the account holders personal development plan for increasing the independence of the person.

This paragraph does not apply to improvements, repairs or modifications made to a rented primary dwelling to achieve or maintain a habitable condition for which ORS 90.320 (1) places responsibility on the landlord. As used in this paragraph, accessible and visitable have the meanings given those terms in ORS 456.508. (h) The purchase of equipment, technology or specialized training, as specified in the account holders personal development plan, that allows the person to become competitive in obtaining or maintaining employment, to start or maintain a business, or to increase the independence of an account holder. (i) The purchase or repair of a vehicle, as specified in the account holders personal development plan for increasing the independence of the person. (j) The saving of funds for retirement, as specified in the account holders personal development plan for increasing the independence of the person.

(L) The creation or improvement of a credit score by obtaining a secured loan or a financial product that is designed to improve credit, as specified in the account holders personal development plan for increasing the independence of the person. (m) The replacement of a primary residence when replacement offers significant opportunity to improve habitability or energy efficiency. (n) The establishment of savings for emergency expenses to promote financial stability and to protect existing assets as specified in the account holders personal development plan. As used in this paragraph, emergency expenses includes expenses for extraordinary medical costs or other unexpected and substantial personal expenses that would significantly impact the account holders noncash assets, health, housing or standard of living if not promptly addressed. (2)(a) An account holder may withdraw all or part of the account holders deposits to an individual development account for any financial hardship as determined by the account holder, without regard to whether the account was established for emergency savings. (b) The fiduciary organization shall remove from an account holders account any moneys deposited as matching funds to deposits withdrawn under this section, unless the withdrawn deposits were deposited and withdrawn for emergency expenses under subsection (1)(n) of this section.

(b) Upon withdrawal of all moneys in the individual development account as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the account relationship shall terminate. (c) The rollover of moneys into a savings network account for higher education under this subsection may not cause the amount in the savings network account for higher education to exceed the limit on total contributions established pursuant to ORS 178.335. (d) Any amount of the rollover that has been subtracted on the taxpayers federal return pursuant to section 219 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be added back in the determination of taxable income. (4) If an account holder moves from the area where the program is conducted or is otherwise unable to continue in the program, the fiduciary organization may remove the account holder from the program.

A communitys pattern of development can accommodate a growing population and help rebuild rural and distressed economies while maintaining the states quality of life. Downtown areas need to be revitalized to accommodate more business and civic activity. Affordable housing must be developed near job centers. Rural and distressed communities need to be rebuilt to allow all sectors of the state to share in economic prosperity. (2) Numerous barriers exist to achieving vibrant downtown areas and community centers, ample affordable housing and thriving rural economies. Overcoming those barriers will require the state to work in partnership with local communities, the private sector and community-based groups to provide livability. Regulations must be balanced with incentives. Private sector financing must be better leveraged. Local planning and zoning codes must allow the redevelopment of strategic infill sites. The needs of working families for housing, transportation and services that are affordable and accessible must be addressed by the entire community. (3) A critical element in the creation of effective partnerships is a flexible funding source that can serve as an incentive to achieving quality development. Careful targeting of financial incentives can provide the needed impetus for revitalization of downtown areas throughout the state, the creation of affordable housing in the proper places and new job centers in places working to attract new growth. (4) State government, in tandem with local and federal governments, nonprofit organizations and the business sector, provides a variety of tools to help build strong Oregon communities. Targeted financial incentives will complement existing tools and allow state government and its partners to enhance livability and make cost-effective use of public infrastructure. The resulting communities will be economically viable and will have housing that is affordable to community residents. [1999 c.956 1] Note:",
