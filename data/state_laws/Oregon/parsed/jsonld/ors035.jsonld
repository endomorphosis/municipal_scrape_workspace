(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a public body as defined in ORS 174.109 may not condemn private real property used as a residence, business establishment, farm or forest operation if at the time of the condemnation the public body intends to convey fee title to all or a portion of the real property, or a lesser interest than fee title, to another private party. (2) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to condemnation of: (a) Improved or unimproved real property that constitutes a danger to the health or safety of the community by reason of contamination, dilapidated structures, improper or insufficient water or sanitary facilities, or any combination of these factors; (b) Any timber, crops, topsoil, gravel or fixtures to be removed from the real property being condemned; or (c) Real property condemned for maintenance, improvement, or construction of transportation facilities, transportation systems, utility facilities or utility transmission systems. (3) Subsection (1) of this section does not prohibit a public body from leasing a portion of a public facility to a privately owned business for the provision of retail services designed primarily to serve the patrons of the public facility. (4) A public body as defined in ORS 174.109 may at any time publish notice that the public body intends to consider condemnation of a lot or parcel. If the public body publishes notice under this subsection, subsection (1) of this section does not apply for such time necessary to provide the public body reasonable opportunity to condemn the property, if the lot or parcel is conveyed by the owner of the lot or parcel to another private party after the notice is published, but prior to the time the property is condemned. (5) Subsection (1) of this section does not affect the ability of a public body as defined in ORS 174.109 to make a conveyance of a nonpossessory interest in condemned property for the purpose of financing acquisition of the property. (6) A court shall independently determine whether a taking of property complies with the requirements of this section, without deference to any determination made by the public body. If a court determines that a taking of property does not comply with the requirements of this section, the owner of the lot or parcel that is the subject of the condemnation proceeding shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees, expenses, costs and other disbursements reasonably incurred to defend against the proposed condemnation.",

      "text": "Offer to purchase required before filing action for condemnation; appraisal; arbitration; when costs and disbursements allowed. (1) At least 40 days before the filing of any action for condemnation of property or any interest in property, the condemner shall make a written offer to the owner or party having an interest to purchase the property or interest, and to pay just compensation therefor and for any compensable damages to remaining property. (2) The offer shall be accompanied by any written appraisal upon which the condemner relied in establishing the amount of compensation offered. If the condemner determines that the amount of just compensation due is less than $20,000, the condemner, in lieu of a written appraisal, may provide to the owner or other person having an interest in the property a written explanation of the bases and method by which the condemner arrived at the specific valuation of the property. The amount of just compensation offered shall not be reduced by amendment or otherwise before or during trial except on order of the court entered not less than 60 days prior to trial. An order for reduction of just compensation offered, pleaded by the condemner in the complaint or deposited with the court for the use and benefit of the owner pending outcome of the condemnation action, may be entered only upon motion of the condemner and a finding by clear and convincing evidence that the appraisal upon which the original offer is based was the result of a mistake of material fact that was not known and could not reasonably have been known at the time of the original appraisal or was based on a mistake of law. (3) Unless otherwise agreed to by the condemner and the owner, prior to appraising the property the condemner shall provide not less than 15 days written notice to the owner of the planned appraisal inspection. The property owner and designated representative, if any, shall be invited to accompany the condemners appraiser on any inspection of the property for appraisal purposes. (4) The owner has not less than 40 days from the date the owner receives the written offer required by subsection (1) of this section, accompanied by the appraisal or written explanation required by subsection (2) of this section, to accept or reject the offer. If the owner rejects the condemners offer and obtains a separate appraisal, the owner shall provide the condemner with a copy of the owners appraisal not less than 60 days prior to trial or arbitration. (5)(a) Failure to provide the opposing party with a copy of the appropriate appraisal as provided in subsections (2) and (4) of this section shall prohibit the use of the appraisal in arbitration or at trial. (b) In the event the owner and condemner are unable to reach agreement and proceed to trial or arbitration as provided in subsection (6) of this section, each party to the proceeding shall provide to every other party a copy of every appraisal obtained by the party as part of the condemnation action. (6)(a) If an action based on the condemnation is filed, the owner may elect to have compensation determined by binding arbitration if the total amount of compensation claimed by any party does not exceed $20,000. Notice of an election of binding arbitration must be given to the condemner at least 90 days prior to the date on which an arbitration hearing is scheduled under ORS 36.420. (b) Notwithstanding the amount established under ORS 36.400, if the owner elects to proceed with binding arbitration, the arbitration shall be conducted according to the mandatory arbitration program established under ORS 36.400 to 36.425. Notwithstanding ORS 36.425, no party may request a trial de novo after the filing of the decision and award of the arbitrator. Within 20 days after the filing of the decision and award of the arbitrator under ORS 36.425, any party may file a motion with the court for the vacation, modification or correction of the award. The court may vacate an award only if there is a basis to vacate the award described in ORS 36.705 (1)(a) to (d). The court may modify or correct an award only for the grounds given in ORS 36.710. Except as provided in this subsection, no party may appeal from the decision and award of an arbitrator if the owner elects binding arbitration in lieu of trial. (c) If the total amount of compensation claimed exceeds $20,000 but is less than $50,000, the owner may elect to have compensation determined by nonbinding arbitration under the applicable provisions of ORS 36.400 to 36.425. (7) If a trial is held or arbitration conducted for the fixing of the amount of compensation to be awarded to the defendant owner or party having an interest in the property being condemned, the court or arbitrator shall award the defendant costs and disbursements including reasonable attorney fees and reasonable expenses as defined in ORS 35.335 (2) in the following cases, and no other: (a) If the amount of just compensation assessed by the verdict in the trial exceeds the highest written offer in settlement submitted by condemner before the filing of the action to those defendants appearing in the action pursuant to subsection (1) of this section; or (b) If the court finds that the first written offer made by condemner to defendant in settlement before the filing of the action did not constitute a good faith offer of an amount reasonably believed by condemner to be just compensation. (8) If any appraisal provided to a party under this section relies on a written report, opinion or estimate of a person who is not an appraiser, a copy of the written report, opinion or estimate must be provided with the appraisal. If any appraisal provided under this section relies on an unwritten report, opinion or estimate of a person who is not an appraiser, the party providing the appraisal must also provide the name and address of the person who provided the unwritten report, opinion or estimate. (9) Costs and disbursements other than reasonable attorney fees and expenses as defined in ORS 35.335 (2) shall be awarded to condemner in all cases other than those in which defendant is entitled to costs and disbursements under subsection (7) of this section.",

(1) At any time after a condemnation action is commenced, a public condemner may serve notice that the public condemner will take immediate possession of the property that is the subject of the action. The notice must be served in the manner provided by ORCP 9 on all defendants in the action. (2) If notice is served under this section, a defendant in a condemnation action may object to immediate possession of property by a public condemner by filing a written objection with the court within 10 days after notice is served on the defendant under this section and serving a copy of the objection on the public condemner in the manner provided by ORCP 9. The objection must request that the court schedule a hearing on the objection at the earliest possible time. The only issues that a court may consider upon objection are: (a) Whether the condemnation is legal; and (b) Subject to the presumption established by ORS 35.235 (2), whether the public condemner has acted in bad faith, engaged in fraud or engaged in an abuse of discretion under a delegation of authority. (3) If notice is served under this section and an objection is not filed with the court within the time allowed under subsection (2) of this section, the public condemner may at any time thereafter file with the court a form of order confirming the public condemners possession of the property as of the date specified in the notice.

(2) Upon a finding under subsection (1) of this section, a condemner shall notify the prior owner or designated beneficiary of the requested change in period. The condemner shall negotiate with the prior owner or beneficiary on the requested change. (a) Notification under this subsection shall consist of mailing a letter by certified mail to the last address of the prior owner or the designated beneficiary of the owner as shown in the agreement or judgment whereby the real property was acquired or the address subsequently supplied by such owner or beneficiary. If no response has been received by the condemner within 60 days after receipt of notice by the owner or designated beneficiary, all the rights of the owner or designated beneficiary under ORS 35.385 to 35.415 shall be considered waived. (b) If the condemner cannot locate the prior owner or the designated beneficiary of the owner at the last-known address of the owner or the designated beneficiary, notice may be effected by publication. The publication shall be made in a newspaper published in the county where the property is located, or if no newspaper is published in the county, then in a newspaper designated as being most likely to give notice to the prior owner or the beneficiary of the prior owner. The newspaper utilized shall meet the requirements of ORS 193.020. The notice shall contain the name of the public project, a general description of the location of the property, the change in purpose or extension of time desired by the condemner and a time within which the owner or the beneficiary of the owner must respond to the notice. The notice shall be published not less than once each week for four weeks. The publication of notice may be directed to one or more owners or beneficiaries affected by the same project. If no response is received by the condemner within 10 days after the date of the last publication of notice, all rights of the prior owner or designated beneficiary shall be considered waived.

(1) At the time of entering into an agreement pursuant to ORS 35.385 (1) for the acquisition of real property by a condemner or prior to the time of giving judgment for the acquisition of real property by a condemner under ORS 35.325, the owner of the real property to be acquired may, if such owner has not waived the right of repurchase under ORS 35.385 to 35.415, designate a person to exercise such right of repurchase. Such designation shall constitute an assignment of the right of the owner of such property to exercise the right of repurchase otherwise available under ORS 35.385 to 35.415. The name and address of the person so designated shall be included in such agreement or judgment. Such owners and designated beneficiaries shall also notify the condemner in writing of any change of address so that their respective current addresses shall be of record with the condemner. The person so designated may not assign or transfer the right of repurchase. (2) If an owner of real property to be acquired by a condemner does not designate a person to exercise the right of repurchase under ORS 35.385 to 35.415 and such owner has not waived such right of repurchase, only the owner may exercise the right of repurchase under ORS 35.385 to 35.415. If such owner dies while real property is still subject to a right of repurchase by the owner, the personal representative of such owners estate may act as the owner to exercise the right of repurchase with respect to such property on behalf of the estate of the owner at any time prior to the discharge of the personal representative under ORS 116.213. (3) Upon receipt from a condemner of an offer to repurchase any real property or portion thereof in accordance with ORS 35.385 to 35.415: (a) In the case of an offer to repurchase the entire parcel of real property to which ORS 35.385 applies, if the owner or beneficiary of such right of repurchase does not accept such offer within 30 days, the right of repurchase is terminated and the condemner may use and dispose of such property or portion as otherwise provided by law. (b) In the case of an offer to repurchase only a portion of a parcel of real property to which ORS 35.385 applies, the owner or beneficiary of such right of repurchase may: (A) Accept such offer within 30 days; or (B) Notify the condemner within 30 days of the desire of the owner or beneficiary to exercise such right, but refuse to accept the price established by the condemner in the offer to repurchase made pursuant to ORS 35.390 (4). (c) If the owner or beneficiary of the right of repurchase fails to timely notify the condemner pursuant to either paragraph (b)(A) or (B) of this subsection, the right of repurchase is terminated and the condemner may use or dispose of such portion of property as otherwise provided by law. (d) If timely notice of intent to exercise the right of repurchase is given by the owner or beneficiary as provided by paragraph (b)(B) of this subsection, the owner or beneficiary must within 60 days thereafter commence an action, in the court in which the original action by the condemner to acquire such real property was commenced, to determine the sole issue of the price to be paid upon such repurchase, pursuant to the provisions of ORS 35.390 (3). Failure to commence such an action within such 60-day period shall void such notice of intention to exercise repurchase for the purposes of paragraph (c) of this subsection.

Failure to make such payment into court within 90 days of the date of the judgment shall void the notice of intent to exercise the right of repurchase for the purposes of paragraph (c) of this subsection, and the judgment shall be withdrawn by the court.
