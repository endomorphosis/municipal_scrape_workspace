(2) The economy and well-being of the people are in large part dependent upon proper utilization of the states outdoor recreation resources for the physical, spiritual, cultural, scientific and other benefits which such resources afford. (3) It is in the public interest to increase outdoor recreation opportunities commensurate with the growth in need through necessary and appropriate actions, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) Protection of existing and needed open spaces for appreciation, use and enjoyment of Oregons scenic landscape. (b) Provision of adequate land for outdoor recreation.

In carrying out its responsibilities, the State Parks and Recreation Commission may: (1) Acquire by purchase, agreement, donation or by exercise of eminent domain, real property or any right or interest therein deemed necessary for the operation and development of state parks, roads, trails, campgrounds, picnic areas, boat ramps, nature study areas, waysides, relaxation areas, visitor and interpretive centers, department management facilities, such as shops, equipment sheds, office buildings, park ranger residences or other real property or any right or interest because of its natural, scenic, cultural, historic or recreational value, or any other places of attraction and scenic or historic value which in the judgment of the State Parks and Recreation Department will contribute to the general welfare, enjoyment and pleasure of the public. (2) Construct, improve, develop, manage, operate and maintain facilities and areas, including but not limited to roads, trails, campgrounds, picnic areas, boat ramps and nature study areas named in subsection (1) of this section. (3) Sell, lease, exchange or otherwise dispose or permit use of real or personal property, including equipment and materials acquired by the department, if in the opinion of the department it is no longer needed, required or useful for department purposes, except that: (a) Real property may be leased when such real property will not be needed for department purposes during the leasing period. (b) Real property used for park purposes may be donated to the United States Department of Interior for the purpose of establishing a national monument when in the judgment of the department such disposition would best serve the interests of this state. (c) Proceeds from the sale of all surplus or unsuitable lands held for park purposes shall be deposited in the Parks Donation Trust Fund for use for park land acquisition or development. Proceeds from the sale of other property shall be paid by the department to the State Treasurer for credit to the State Parks and Recreation Department Fund, and any interest from this fund shall be credited to this fund. (d)(A) Before offering forest products for sale, the department shall cause the forest products to be appraised. (B) If the appraised value of the forest products exceeds $25,000, the department shall offer the forest products for sale by competitive bid. A sale under this paragraph is not subject to the Public Contracting Code. Prior to such bid offering, the department shall give notice not less than once a week for three consecutive weeks by publication in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the county in which the forest products are located and by such other media of communication as the department deems advisable. The minimum bid price and a brief statement of the terms and conditions of the sale must be in the notice. (C) The notice and competitive bidding under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph are not required if the State Parks and Recreation Director declares an emergency to exist that requires the immediate removal of the timber. If an emergency has been so declared: (i) The timber, regardless of value, may be sold by a negotiated price; and (ii) The director shall make available for public inspection a written statement giving the reasons for declaring the emergency. (e) In the case of real property acquired by eminent domain, the prior owner of real property for which sale, lease, exchange or other disposal is proposed must be given the first opportunity to reacquire the property in accordance with ORS chapter 35. (4) Enter into contracts deemed necessary for the construction, maintenance, operation, improvement or betterment of parks or for the accomplishment of the purposes of chapter 904, Oregon Laws 1989. All contracts executed by the department shall be made in the name of this state, by and through the department. (5) In carrying out its duties, functions and powers under this chapter, publish guides and other materials relating to recreational opportunities in this state or to any program or function administered by the department. The department may arrange for the sale of such publications. The price of such publications shall include the cost of publishing and distributing the materials. All moneys received by the department from the sale of publications shall be deposited in the State Parks and Recreation Department Fund. The department may contract for the publication of the materials described in this subsection, including the research, design and writing of the materials. The contract may include, among other matters, provisions for advance payment or reimbursement for services performed under the contract.

Each separate subaccount established under this subsection must be separately accounted for. Moneys placed in a subaccount must be used for the purposes for which they are deposited. (4) All of the moneys in the fund except those moneys described in subsection (3), (5), (6), (7), (8) or (9) of this section must be deposited in a separate subaccount within the fund and used by the State Parks and Recreation Department for the acquisition, development, maintenance, care and use of park and recreation sites. The moneys deposited in the subaccount under this subsection must be accounted for separately and stated separately in the State Parks and Recreation Departments biennial budget. (5)(a) Forty-five percent of the amount transferred to the State Parks and Recreation Department under ORS 366.512 from the registration of travel trailers, campers and motor homes and under ORS 803.601 from recreational vehicle trip permits must be deposited in a separate subaccount within the fund to be distributed for the acquisition, development, maintenance, care and use of county park and recreation sites. The moneys deposited in the subaccount under this paragraph must be accounted for separately. The following apply to the distribution of moneys under this paragraph: (A) The moneys must be distributed among the several counties for the purposes described in this paragraph. The distribution shall be made at times determined by the State Parks and Recreation Department but must be made not less than once a year. (B) The sums designated under this paragraph must be remitted to the county treasurers of the several counties by warrant. (b) The department shall establish an advisory committee to advise the department in the performance of its duties under this subsection. The composition of the advisory committee under this subsection is as determined by the department by rule. In determining the composition of the advisory committee, the department shall attempt to provide reasonable representation for county officials or employees with responsibilities relating to county parks and recreation sites. (c) The department, by rule, shall establish a program to provide moneys to counties for the acquisition, development, maintenance, care and use of county park and recreation sites. The rules under this paragraph shall provide for distribution of moneys based on use and need and, as the department determines necessary, on the need for the development and maintenance of facilities to provide camping sites for campers, motor homes and travel trailers. (d) The counties may not use the moneys received under this subsection to supplant moneys otherwise made available to the counties for the acquisition, development, maintenance, care and use of county park and recreation sites. (e) On or before January 15 of each odd-numbered year regular session of the Legislative Assembly, the State Parks and Recreation Director and a representative of the directors of county park and recreation sites shall submit a report to the Joint Committee on Ways and Means created by ORS 171.555, or the Joint Interim Committee on Ways and Means, that describes the measurable biennial and cumulative results of county activities and programs financed by moneys transferred to the counties from the registration of travel trailers, campers and motor homes and from recreational vehicle trip permits. Notwithstanding ORS 192.230 to 192.250, the report shall be made in a manner as the committee may prescribe. (6) The department shall create a separate City and County Subaccount within the fund to be used to reimburse cities and counties as provided in ORS 390.290. (7) The department shall create a separate rural Fire Protection District Subaccount to be used to provide funds for the fire protection districts as provided in ORS 390.290. (8) Twelve percent of the amount transferred to the State Parks and Recreation Department Fund from the Parks Subaccount shall be used only to carry out the purposes and achievements described in ORS 390.135 (2) and (3) through the awarding of grants to regional or local government entities to acquire property for public parks, natural areas or outdoor recreation areas or to develop or improve public parks, natural areas or outdoor recreation areas. Moneys described in this subsection may not be used to pay the cost of administering grants or the cost of any Secretary of State audit required under section 4c, Article XV of the Oregon Constitution. (9) If the amount transferred to the State Parks and Recreation Department Fund from the Parks Subaccount during a biennium is more than 150 percent of the amount that was transferred during the 2009-2011 biennium, the State Treasurer shall, during the next following biennium, deposit for use as described in subsection (8) of this section the amount required under subsection (8) of this section plus an amount equal to the difference between the amount deposited for use as described in subsection (8) of this section during the preceding biennium and 25 percent of the moneys transferred to the State Parks and Recreation Department Fund from the Parks Subaccount during the preceding biennium. (10) Subsections (8) and (9) of this section apply only for biennia in which the Legislative Assembly does not require a greater percentage of the amount transferred to the State Parks and Recreation Department Fund from the Parks Subaccount to be used for the purposes described in subsection (8) of this section. The Legislative Assembly may not authorize the percentage of the amount transferred to the State Parks and Recreation Department Fund from the Parks Subaccount that is deposited for use as described in subsection (8) of this section in a biennium to be less than the percentage required to be deposited under subsections (8) and (9) of this section. (11) On or before January 15 of each odd-numbered year, the director shall submit a report to the Joint Committee on Ways and Means created by ORS 171.555, or the Joint Interim Committee on Ways and Means, that describes the measurable biennial and cumulative results of activities and programs financed by moneys transferred to the State Parks and Recreation Department Fund from the Parks Subaccount.

(3)(a) For the purpose of making grants under the program, the department shall adopt a formula that: (A) Provides for grant funds to be made available statewide while concentrating funds and resources in those areas of the state with the greatest need for main street revitalization and economic development; and (B) Provides that a minimum of 50 percent of available grant funds will be reserved for projects in rural areas. (b) In awarding grants under the program, the department shall give priority to grant proposals for projects that are located in traditionally underserved communities, including rural areas and communities that demonstrate significant financial barriers to efforts to redevelop or rehabilitate downtown areas. (4) The department shall develop criteria to determine the eligibility of grant applicants and proposed projects. The criteria must require that applicants be organizations that participate in the Oregon Main Street Network and demonstrate the past or prospective capacity to work with project leaders in designated local communities or downtown areas. (5) Project proposals submitted by grant applicants may include evidence of demonstrated need for main street revitalization and economic development by providing information about the economic character of the project, including but not limited to: (a) The proportion of households at or below the federal poverty rate in the targeted project location and the surrounding community; (b) The area median income in the proposed project location and surrounding community; (c) The percentage of renters in the proposed project location and surrounding community; and (d) The percentage of persons in the proposed project location and surrounding community with weekly wages that are less than or equal to the most recent federal poverty guidelines for a family of three that are applicable to Oregon residents and that are published annually in the Federal Register by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. (6) The State Parks and Recreation Department shall: (a) Provide technical assistance and project overview and monitoring for successful grant recipients; and (b) Provide regular updates to other state agencies, including but not limited to the Oregon Business Development Department and the Department of Transportation, that have an interest in the implementation and administration of the program. (7) Each grant awarded under this section shall require, as a condition of receiving funding, matching funds in an amount to be determined by the State Parks and Recreation Department. (8) All amounts awarded as grants must be used by recipients, for the approved purposes set forth in successful grant applications, within three years of receipt of the funds. Any funds not expended within that time period must be returned to the department for deposit in the Oregon Main Street Revitalization Grant Program Fund.

(2) In providing for the development and maintenance of the Willamette River Greenway, the Legislative Assembly: (a) Recognizing the need for coordinated planning for such greenway, finds it necessary to provide for development and implementation of a plan for such greenway through the cooperative efforts of the state and units of local government. (b) Recognizing the need of the people of this state for existing residential, commercial and agricultural use of lands along the Willamette River, finds it necessary to permit the continuation of existing uses of lands that are included within such greenway; but, for the benefit of the people of this state, also to limit the intensification and change in the use of such lands so that such uses shall remain, to the greatest possible degree, compatible with the preservation of the natural, scenic, historical and recreational qualities of such lands. (c) Recognizing that the use of lands for farm use is compatible with the purposes of the Willamette River Greenway, finds that the use of lands for farm use should be continued within the greenway without restriction. (d) Recognizing the need for central coordination of such greenway for the best interests of all the people of this state, finds it necessary to place the responsibility for the coordination of the development and maintenance of such greenway in the State Parks and Recreation Department.

(2) If any land acquired by the department under subsection (1) or (4) of this section is a part of a larger tract of land devoted to farm use on the date of the acquisition of such portion of the tract and such acquisition would render uneconomic an otherwise economic farming unit on the whole tract of land, upon the request of the owner of such tract of land, the department shall purchase the entire tract of land. The department shall, whenever practicable, acquire the remainder of any such tract of land with state funds so that the subsequent disposition of any such land will not be subject to restrictions imposed under agreements made for the receipt of nonstate funds otherwise available for the acquisition of such lands. (3) The department may dispose of lands acquired pursuant to subsection (2) of this section that are located outside the boundaries of the Willamette River Greenway as it considers advisable. However, the disposition of any such lands must comply with the laws of this state and the applicable provisions of any agreement by which the department acquired funds for the purchase of such lands.

(5) In the acquisition of any lands pursuant to subsections (1), (2) and (4) of this section, the department shall include in the compensation and damages, if any, paid for such lands: (a) As a part of the compensation, in valuing such lands as a whole, paid for any such lands acquired without condemnation proceedings initiated as provided in ORS 35.235, the estimated market value of economically extractable subsurface mineral aggregate deposits of reasonably foreseeable demand known to exist in such lands or shown by the owner to exist in such lands. (b) As a part of the compensation and damages, if any, in valuing such lands as a whole, for the appropriation of any such lands, acquired by the department after the commencement of condemnation proceedings under ORS 35.235 but not pursuant to an award in a condemnation action initiated under ORS 35.245, the estimated market value of economically extractable subsurface mineral aggregate deposits of reasonably foreseeable demand agreed upon by the department and the owner of lands so acquired. (c) As a part of the true value and damages, in valuing such lands as a whole, for the appropriation of such lands acquired by award in a condemnation action initiated under ORS 35.245, the estimated market value of economically extractable subsurface mineral aggregate deposits of reasonably foreseeable demand alleged in the answer of the defendant made pursuant to ORS 35.295 and proved by the defendant as a matter of defense to be a part of the true value of such lands so acquired. (6) This section does not apply to the acquisition of any lands or interests therein acquired for state parks or recreation areas prior to October 5, 1973, and to any lands or interests in land subject to a legally enforceable option held by the state on October 5, 1973, for the purposes of the acquisition of such lands or interests for state parks and recreation areas.

The people of Oregon find that many of the free-flowing rivers of Oregon and Waldo Lake and lands adjacent to such lake and rivers possess outstanding scenic, fish, wildlife, geological, botanical, historic, archaeologic, and outdoor recreation values of present and future benefit to the public. The people of Oregon also find that the policy of permitting construction of dams and other impoundment facilities at appropriate sections of the rivers of Oregon and Waldo Lake needs to be complemented by a policy that would preserve Waldo Lake and selected rivers or sections thereof in a free-flowing condition and would protect and preserve the natural setting and water quality of the lake and such rivers and fulfill other conservation purposes. It is therefore the policy of Oregon to preserve for the benefit of the public Waldo Lake and selected parts of the states free-flowing rivers. For these purposes there is established an Oregon Scenic Waterways System to be composed of areas designated in accordance with ORS 390.805 to 390.925 and any subsequent Acts.",

      "text": "(1) It is declared that the highest and best uses of the waters within scenic waterways are recreation, fish and wildlife uses. The free-flowing character of these waters shall be maintained in quantities necessary for recreation, fish and wildlife uses. A dam, reservoir or other water impoundment facility may not be constructed on waters within scenic waterways. A water diversion facility may not be constructed or used except by right previously established or as permitted by the Water Resources Commission, upon a finding that such diversion is necessary to uses designated in ORS 536.310 (12), and in a manner consistent with the policies set forth under ORS 390.805 to 390.925. The Water Resources Commission shall administer and enforce the provisions of this subsection. (2) Filling of the beds or removal of material from or other alteration of the beds or banks of scenic waterways for purposes other than recreational prospecting not requiring a permit shall be prohibited, except as permitted by the Director of the Department of State Lands upon a finding that such activity would be consistent with the policies set forth under ORS 390.805 to 390.925 for scenic waterways and in a manner consistent with the policies set forth under ORS 196.800 to 196.825 and 196.845 to 196.870 for removal of material from the beds and banks and filling of any waters of this state. The Director of the Department of State Lands shall administer and enforce the provisions of this subsection. (3)(a) Upon a finding of emergency circumstances, the Director of the Department of State Lands may issue a temporary permit for the removal, filling or alteration of the beds or banks within a scenic waterway. The temporary permit shall include conditions developed after consultation with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife and the State Parks and Recreation Department. (b) As used in this subsection, emergency circumstances exist if prompt action is necessary to prevent irreparable harm, injury or damage to persons or property. (4) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by the grant or denial of a permit under subsection (2) or (3) of this section may appeal in accordance with the procedure set forth in ORS 196.835. (5) Nothing in ORS 390.805 to 390.925 affects the authority of the State Fish and Wildlife Commission to construct facilities or make improvements to facilitate the passage or propagation of fish or to exercise other responsibilities in managing fish and wildlife resources. Nothing in ORS 390.805 to 390.925 affects the authority of the Water Resources Commission to construct and maintain stream gauge stations and other facilities related to the commissions duties in administration of the water laws. (6) Upon a finding of necessity under subsection (1) of this section, the Water Resources Commission may issue a water right for human consumption not to exceed 0.005 cubic feet per second per household, or livestock consumption uses not to exceed one-tenth of one cubic foot per second per 1,000 head of livestock, as designated in ORS 536.310 (12) within or above a scenic waterway if the Water Resources Commission makes the following findings: (a) That issuing the water right does not significantly impair the free-flowing character of these waters in quantities necessary for recreation, fish and wildlife. (b) That issuing the water right is consistent with provisions pertaining to water appropriation and water rights under ORS chapters 536 and 537 and rules adopted thereunder. (c) That construction, operation and maintenance of the diversion system will be carried out in a manner consistent with the purposes set forth in ORS 390.805 to 390.925. (d) If the water right is for human consumption, an additional finding that: (A) The applicant cannot reasonably obtain water from any other source; (B) Denial of the water right would result in loss of reasonable expectations for use of the property; and (C) The system installed to divert water shall include monitoring equipment to permit water use measurement and reporting. (e) If the water right is for livestock consumption, an additional finding that: (A) The right is necessary to prevent the livestock from watering in or along the stream bed; (B) The applicant cannot reasonably obtain water from any other source; and (C) The applicant has excluded livestock from the stream and its adjacent riparian zone. (7) In making the findings required under subsection (6) of this section, the Water Resources Commission shall consider the existing or potential cumulative impacts of issuing the water right. (8) The Water Resources Commission may not allow human consumption and livestock uses authorized under subsection (6) of this section in excess of a combined cumulative total of one percent of the average daily flow or one cubic foot per second, whichever is less, unless: (a) The Water Resources Commission, the State Parks and Recreation Department, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Environmental Quality and the Department of State Lands unanimously agree to exceed that amount; and (b) Exceeding that amount will not significantly impair the free-flowing character of these waters in quantities necessary for recreation, fish and wildlife. (9)(a) The provisions of this section do not apply to a water right application for the use of ground water as defined in ORS 537.515, except upon a finding by the Water Resources Director based on a preponderance of evidence that the use of ground water will measurably reduce the surface water flows necessary to maintain the free-flowing character of a scenic waterway in quantities necessary for recreation, fish and wildlife. (b) The Water Resources Department shall review every application for the use of ground water to determine whether to make the finding specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection. The finding shall be based upon the application of generally accepted hydrogeologic methods using relevant and available field information concerning the proposed use. (c) In making the determination required by paragraph (a) of this subsection, the Water Resources Department shall consider the timing of projected impacts of the proposed use in relation to other factors, including but not limited to: Changing climate, recharge, incidental precipitation, out-of-stream appropriations and return flows. (d) If the Water Resources Director makes the finding specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the Water Resources Director shall issue an order denying the application unless: (A) Mitigation is provided in accordance with subsection (10) of this section; or (B) The applicant submits evidence to overcome the finding under paragraph (a) of this subsection. (e) Except as provided under subsection (13) of this section, if the Water Resources Director does not make the finding specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the Water Resources Director shall issue an order approving the application if the application otherwise meets the requirements of ORS 537.505 to 537.795. (f) A protest of any order issued under this subsection may be filed in the same manner as a protest on any application for a right to appropriate ground water. (g) Each water right permit and certificate for appropriation of ground water issued after July 19, 1995, for which a source of appropriation is within or above a scenic waterway shall be conditioned to allow the regulation of the use if analysis of data available after the permit or certificate is issued discloses that the appropriation will measurably reduce the surface water flows necessary to maintain the free-flowing character of a scenic waterway in quantities necessary for recreation, fish and wildlife in effect as of the priority date of the right or as those quantities may be subsequently reduced. (h) This subsection does not limit the use of ground water for a use exempted under ORS 537.545. (10) The Water Resources Commission or Water Resources Director shall consider mitigation measures and may include mitigation measures as conditions in any water right permit or certificate to ensure the maintenance of the free-flowing character of the scenic waterway in quantities necessary for recreation, fish and wildlife. (11) The Water Resources Commission and the Water Resources Director shall carry out their responsibilities under ORS 536.220 to 536.590 with respect to the waters within scenic waterways in conformity with the provisions of this section. (12) As used in this section, measurably reduce means that the use authorized under subsection (9) of this section will individually or cumulatively reduce surface water flows within the scenic waterway in excess of a combined cumulative total of one percent of the average daily flow or one cubic foot per second, whichever is less, unless: (a) The Water Resources Department, the State Parks and Recreation Department, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Environmental Quality and the Department of State Lands unanimously agree to exceed that amount; and (b) Exceeding that amount will not significantly impair the free-flowing character of these waters in quantities necessary for recreation, fish and wildlife. (13) Before authorizing an appropriation that will reduce streamflows within a scenic waterway in amounts up to but not exceeding the amounts described in subsection (12) of this section, the Water Resources Director shall find: (a) That the appropriation will not significantly impair the free-flowing character of these waters in quantities necessary for recreation, fish and wildlife. (b) That the appropriation is consistent with provisions pertaining to water appropriations and water rights under ORS chapters 536 and 537 and the rules adopted thereunder. (c) That construction, operation and maintenance of the appropriation will be carried out in a manner consistent with the purposes set forth in ORS 390.805 to 390.925. (14) Placer mining is not permitted on waters within scenic waterways, other than recreational placer mining. (15) A person may not be required to obtain a permit for recreational prospecting or other nonmotorized recreational activity resulting in the fill, removal or other alteration of less than one cubic yard of material at any one individual site and, cumulatively, not more than five cubic yards of material from within the bed or wet perimeter of any single scenic waterway in a single year. Recreational prospecting shall not occur at any site where fish eggs are present. (16) This section does not exempt recreational placer mining on a scenic waterway, other than recreational prospecting not requiring a permit, from compliance with the provisions of ORS 196.800 to 196.825 and 196.845 to 196.870 or rules adopted pursuant to ORS 196.800 to 196.825 and 196.845 to 196.870. (17) Recreational placer mining may not: (a) Dam or divert a waterway or obstruct fish passage; (b) Include nozzling, sluicing or digging outside the wet perimeter of the stream, nor extend the wet perimeter; (c) Include movement of boulders, logs, stumps or other woody material from the wet perimeter other than movement by hand and nonmotorized equipment; (d) Involve the disturbance of rooted or embedded woody plants, including trees and shrubs, regardless of their location; (e) Include excavation from the streambank; (f) Fail to level pits, piles, furrows or potholes outside the main channel of the waterway upon leaving the site; (g) Include operation of a suction dredge without a suction dredge waste discharge permit from the Department of Environmental Quality including, but not limited to, a prohibition against dredging during periods when fish eggs could be in the dredging site gravel; (h) Be conducted on federal lands except as allowed by agencies of the federal government; (i) Impede boating; (j) Include operation of a dredge between the hours of 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. within 500 feet of a residence or within 500 feet of a campground except within a federally designated recreational mining site; or (k) Include operation of a dredge within the marked or posted swimming area of a designated campground or day use area except within a federally designated recreational mining site. (18) As used in this section: (a) Bed means the land within the wet perimeter and any adjacent nonvegetated dry gravel bar. (b) Prospecting means to search or explore for samples of gold, silver or other precious minerals, using nonmotorized methods, from among small quantities of aggregate. (c) Recreational placer mining includes, but is not limited to, the use of nonmotorized equipment and motorized surface dredges having an intake nozzle with an inside diameter not exceeding four inches, a motor no larger than 16 horsepower and a muffler meeting or exceeding factory-installed noise reduction standards. Recreational placer mining does not include recreational prospecting that does not require a permit. (d) Wet perimeter means the area of the stream that is underwater, or is exposed as a nonvegetated dry gravel bar island surrounded on all sides by actively moving water at the time the activity occurs. Note: Sections 3 and 4, chapter 499, Oregon Laws 2001, provide: Sec. 3. In order to make recommendations to better achieve the objectives and enhance the effectiveness of the Oregon Scenic Waterways System, the State Parks and Recreation Department shall complete a review of the system administered under ORS 390.805 to 390.925, including a review of the studies pertaining to the effects of recreational placer mining within scenic waterways. At the request of the State Parks and Recreation Department, the Department of State Lands, the Water Resources Department, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, the State Marine Board and the Department of Environmental Quality shall assist in the review. The State Parks and Recreation Department may also request interested public parties to assist in the review. [2001 c.499 3] Sec. 4. Notwithstanding ORS 390.835, a permit or temporary permit for dredging issued by the Department of State Lands for the purpose of recreational placer mining within a scenic waterway is not valid after December 31, 2003, if the review described in section 3 of this 2001 Act has been completed and reported to the Seventy-second Legislative Assembly or, if the review has not been completed and reported to the Seventy-second Legislative Assembly, after December 31, 2005.",

(2) The management plan shall stress a segment by segment design and shall include provisions for the development of appropriate facilities and services in the recreation area to meet resource needs for protection and preservation and user needs. This development may include but need not be limited to: (a) River and car camp development; (b) Sanitation stations for human waste and garbage; (c) Parking and access road improvement; (d) Signs indicating land ownership; (e) Tree and riparian zone protection and restoration; (f) Educational programs; and (g) Initiation of additional volunteer programs. (3) Before restricting access through the use of a permit system, all other management options shall be considered. (4) Special emphasis shall be placed on protecting the recreation area and all adjacent property from recreationist-caused wildfires. This goal shall be equal in priority to the other primary goals set forth in this section.

(c) The establishment of information centers near major points of entry into the recreation area to provide users with information and education regarding the fire rules and general rules of the river.

(b) Located to avoid, in so far as reasonably practicable, established highways, motor roads, mining areas, power transmission lines, existing commercial and industrial developments, range fences and improvements, private logging operations, and any other activities that would be incompatible with the protection of the trailside environment in its natural condition and the use of the trail for outdoor recreation. (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, it is recognized that in many instances (especially in urban areas and for some types of trails across or near private land) it may be advisable to locate segments of trails in or near existing rights of way for roads, highways, public utilities or telecommunications utilities, excluding power transmission lines; and it is recognized that trail rights of way on occasion may be located, or from time to time relocated, through, or adjacent to, lands used for private timber (including logging), agriculture, commercial or industrial operations and that such location or relocation of a trail right of way, of itself, shall not impose any limitation upon an otherwise lawful use of the adjacent private land except to the extent of the terms of any agreement with the private landowner as provided in ORS 390.971 (1) and except as may be provided by any zoning ordinance, law or regulation. (3) The location and width of an Oregon recreation trail right of way across federal lands under the jurisdiction of a federal agency shall be by agreement between that agency and the department. (4) In selecting a right of way, the department shall endeavor to obtain the advice and assistance of the local governments, private organizations, landowners, the land users concerned, and the advisory council established under ORS 390.977. (5) The department shall hold a public hearing in the area of the state where the selection of such right of way is to be made. Subject to ORS 390.971, after public hearing, the department may revise the location and width of a right of way from time to time as required by circumstances, with the consent of the head of any federal agency involved, and with such advice and assistance of the local governments, private organizations, landowners, land users, and the advisory council, as the department considers necessary or advisable.",

      "text": "following: (a) Enter into written cooperative agreements with landowners, federal agencies, other state agencies, local governments, private organizations and individuals in order to provide for the development, operation, maintenance, location and relocation of the trail. Where the trail crosses commercial forestland, such agreement shall make reasonable provision for temporary relocation reasonably required for commercial forest management. (b) Subject to limitations set forth in ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2), acquire lands or interests in lands by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds or exchange, or with funds obtained under ORS 390.980. (2) The department, in the exercise of its exchange authority, may accept title to any nonstate-owned property within a trail right of way, and, in exchange therefor, the department may convey to the grantor of such property any state-owned property under its jurisdiction or the jurisdiction of any state agency consenting to such exchange that the department or the applicable consenting state agency classifies as suitable for exchange or other disposal. The values of the properties so exchanged either shall be approximately equal or, if they are not approximately equal, the values shall be equalized by the payment of cash to the grantor or to the department or applicable consenting state agency as the circumstances require. (3) If lands included in an Oregon recreation trail right of way are outside the exterior boundaries of state or federally administered areas, the department shall attempt, and any local governments involved shall be encouraged, to enter into written cooperative agreements with landowners, local government, private organizations and individuals in order to develop, administer and maintain the trails and to acquire, develop and administer such lands or interests therein. However, if the department or local governments fail or are unable to enter into such agreements or to acquire such lands or interests therein within one year after the selection of the right of way, the department may acquire private lands or interests therein by donation, exchange or purchase with donated or appropriated funds and may develop and administer such lands or interests therein. Exchanges shall be governed by the provisions of subsection (2) of this section. (4) Oregon recreation trails shall be administered, protected, developed and maintained by the department, or as provided under subsection (1)(a) of this section, to retain their natural, scenic and historic features. Along trails in more remote areas, provision may be made for campsites, shelters and related public-use facilities. Other uses, including reasonable crossings for motor vehicles, public utilities and water pipes and ditches, that will not substantially interfere with the nature and purposes of the trails may be permitted or authorized, as appropriate. The use of motorized vehicles by the general public along any such Oregon recreation trail is prohibited. However, the department shall authorize the use of motorized vehicles when, in its judgment, such vehicles are necessary to meet emergencies, trail construction and maintenance needs or to enable adjacent landowners or land users to have reasonable access to their lands or timber rights. The fact that private lands are included in an Oregon recreation trail by cooperative agreement of a landowner does not preclude the owner of such lands or agents of the owner from using motorized vehicles on or across such trails or adjacent lands from time to time in accordance with such agreement. Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, the state laws, rules and regulations applicable to lands or areas included in any Oregon recreation trail shall continue to apply. Nothing in ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2) prohibits the use of roads existing on private lands on September 9, 1971, which may cross or traverse portions of the trail right of way, nor shall ORS 390.950 to 390.989 and 390.995 (2) prevent trails from crossing such roads. (5) The department shall endeavor to induce agreements with appropriate state and federal agencies to provide for youth work projects to assist in the construction and maintenance of trails that are part of the Oregon recreation trails system. (6) The department shall endeavor, when it considers such to be appropriate, to develop and enhance the educational values and opportunities of Oregon recreation trails. In this connection the department shall cooperate with schools, educators and other interested persons or groups in developing and utilizing techniques and materials to demonstrate to and inform the trail-using public of various scenic and natural features visible along or from such trails, including geological, botanical, historical, zoological and similar features.

(8) The department, with the concurrence of any federal agency administering lands through which an Oregon recreation trail passes, and after consultation with the local governments, private organizations and landowners that the department knows or believes to be concerned, and the advisory council established under ORS 390.977, may adopt rules that may be revised from time to time governing protection, management, use, development and administration of an Oregon recreation trail.
