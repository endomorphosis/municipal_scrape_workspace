(2) When a child is taught or is withdrawn from a public school to be taught by a parent, legal guardian or private teacher, as provided in ORS 339.030, the parent, legal guardian or private teacher must notify the education service district in writing. In addition, when a child who is taught by a parent, legal guardian or private teacher moves to a new education service district, the parent, legal guardian or private teacher shall notify the new education service district in writing. The education service district shall acknowledge receipt of any notification in writing. (3) Children being taught as provided in subsection (2) of this section shall be examined at grades 3, 5, 8 and 10 in accordance with the following procedures: (a) The State Board of Education shall adopt by rule a list of approved comprehensive examinations that are readily available. (b)(A) The parent or legal guardian shall select an examination from the approved list and arrange to have the examination administered to the child by a qualified neutral person, as defined by rule by the State Board of Education. (B) If the child was withdrawn from public school, the first examination shall be administered to the child at least 18 months after the date on which the child was withdrawn from public school.

(c) The person administering the examination shall: (A) Score the examination; and (B) Report the results of the examination to the parent or legal guardian. (d) Upon request of the superintendent of the education service district, the parent or legal guardian shall submit the results of the examination to the education service district. (4)(a) If the composite test score of the child places the child below the 15th percentile based on national norms, the child shall be given an additional examination within one year of when the first examination was administered. (b) If the composite test score of the child on the second examination shows a declining score, then the child shall be given an additional examination within one year of when the second examination was administered and the superintendent of the education service district may: (A) Allow the child to continue to be taught by a parent, legal guardian or private teacher; or (B) Place the education of the child under the supervision of a person holding a teaching license who is selected by the parent or legal guardian at the expense of the parent or legal guardian. If the composite test score of the child continues to show a declining score, the superintendent of the education service district may: (i) Allow the child to continue under the educational supervision of a licensed teacher selected by the parent or legal guardian and require that the child be given an additional examination within one year of when the last examination was administered; (ii) Allow the child to be taught by a parent, legal guardian or private teacher and require that the child be given an additional examination within one year of when the last examination was administered; or (iii) Order the parent or legal guardian to send the child to school for a period not to exceed 12 consecutive months as determined by the superintendent. (c) If the parent or legal guardian of the child does not consent to placing the education of the child under the supervision of a licensed teacher who is selected by the parent or legal guardian, then the superintendent of the education service district may order the child to return to school for a period not to exceed 12 consecutive months as determined by the superintendent. (d) If the composite test score of the child on an examination is equal to or greater than the percentile score on the prior test, the child may be taught by a parent, legal guardian or private teacher and for the next examination be examined pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection or subsection (3) of this section. (5)(a) Notwithstanding the examination requirements of subsections (3) and (4) of this section, the parent or legal guardian of a child with a disability who has an individualized education program and is receiving special education and related services through the school district or who is being educated in accordance with a privately developed plan shall be evaluated for satisfactory educational progress according to the recommendations of the program or plan. (b) The parent or legal guardian of a child with a disability who was evaluated by service providers selected by the parent or legal guardian based on a privately developed plan shall submit a report of such evaluation to the education service district in lieu of the examination results required by subsections (3) and (4) of this section. (c) A child with a disability described in this subsection may not be subject to the examination requirements of subsections (3) and (4) of this section unless the examination is recommended in the program or plan in effect for the child.",

(B) For students in any grade from kindergarten through grade eight, activities that are offered only before or after regular school hours and that may, but are not required to, involve interaction among other schools. (e) Public charter school has the meaning given that term in ORS 338.005. (2) A school district may not deny a GED student, a homeschooled student or a student who attends a public charter school that does not provide interscholastic activities the opportunity to participate in all interscholastic activities available in the school district within the attendance boundaries in which the GED student, homeschooled student or public charter school student resides if the student fulfills the following conditions, as applicable: (a)(A) For a GED student or a homeschooled student, the student must meet all school district eligibility requirements except: (i) The school districts school or class attendance requirements; and (ii) The class requirements of the voluntary association that administers the interscholastic activity, if applicable. (B) For a student who attends a public charter school, the student must meet all school district eligibility requirements except the school districts school or class attendance requirements. (b) For a homeschooled student or a student who attends a public charter school, the student must meet one of these requirements: (A) Achieve a minimum score that places the student at or above the 23rd percentile, based on national norms, on an examination from the list the State Board of Education adopts under ORS 339.035. The student must take the examination at the end of each school year, and the students parent or legal guardian must submit the results to the school district for use in determining eligibility for the following year. (B) Meet alternative requirements that a school district adopts, in consultation with the students parent or legal guardian, to participate in interscholastic activities, including but not limited to a requirement that a student submit a portfolio of work samples to a school district committee for review to determine whether the student is eligible to participate in interscholastic activities. (c) For a GED student, the student must demonstrate that, prior to beginning the interscholastic activity, the student has passed at least one practice test administered through the GED program. (3)(a) In addition to the requirements set forth in subsection (2) of this section, a public charter school that enrolls a student who intends to participate in an interscholastic activity must pay to the school district or school that offers the interscholastic activity, as appropriate and if the school district or school requires payment as provided by this subsection: (A) An annual fee that is equivalent to not more than five percent of the amount of the school districts General Purpose Grant per ADMw, as calculated under ORS 327.013; and (B) An additional annual fee that is equivalent to not more than five percent of the amount of the school districts General Purpose Grant per ADMw, as calculated under ORS 327.013, if participating in the interscholastic activity requires the student to enroll in a course for credit. (b) The school district and the public charter school shall enter into an agreement to specify the amount of the fees described in paragraph (a) of this subsection. (c) A public charter school is required to pay a fee described in paragraph (a) of this subsection only once per year per student participating in an interscholastic activity at a school in the school district, regardless of the number of interscholastic activities in which the student participates. (4) A GED student, a homeschooled student or a student who attends a public charter school may participate in interscholastic activities while awaiting examination or practice test results. (5) A GED student, a homeschooled student or a student who attends a public charter school who does not maintain academic eligibility is ineligible to participate in interscholastic activities for the duration of the school year in which the student becomes academically ineligible and for the following year. The student must take the required examinations or practice tests at the end of the second year and meet the standards described in subsection (2)(b) or (c) of this section to become eligible for the third year. (6)(a) A GED student, a homeschooled student or a student who attends a public charter school must fulfill the same responsibilities and standards of behavior and performance, including related class or practice requirements, as other students who participate in the interscholastic activity. The student must also comply with all public school requirements during the time of participation. (b) A student who attends a public charter school must be allowed to participate in an interscholastic activity in the same manner that a resident of the school district may participate in the interscholastic activity. A school district may not give priority to residents of the school district to participate in interscholastic activities, but may require a student who attends a public charter school to satisfy any standards for acceptance for participation. (7) A GED student, a homeschooled student or a student who attends a public charter school who participates in interscholastic activities must reside within the attendance boundaries of the school at which the student participates unless the school district has a policy that allows any student attending a school of the school district to participate in interscholastic activities at any school of the school district.

(1) A district school board that admits nonresident students by giving consent as described in ORS 339.133 (5)(a) may not consider race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity, national origin, disability, health, whether a student has an individualized education program, the terms of an individualized education program, income level, residence, proficiency in the English language, athletic ability or academic records when: (a) Determining whether to give consent; or (b) Establishing any terms of consent. (2) A district school board that is considering whether to admit a nonresident student by giving consent may require only the following information prior to deciding whether to give consent: (a) The name, contact information, date of birth and grade level of the student; (b) Information about whether the school district may be prevented or otherwise limited from providing consent as provided by ORS 339.115 (8); (c) Information about whether the student may be given priority as provided by subsection (4) of this section; and (d) Information about which schools the student prefers to attend. (3)(a) A district school board that is considering whether to admit a nonresident student by giving consent may not: (A) Request or require any person to provide or have provided any of the following information related to a student prior to the district school board deciding whether to give consent to the student: (i) Information about the students race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity, national origin, disability, health, whether a student has an individualized education program, the terms of an individualized education program, income level, residence, proficiency in the English language or athletic ability; or (ii) Academic records, including eligibility for or participation in a talented and gifted program or special education and related services. (B) Request or require the student to participate in an interview, to tour any of the schools or facilities of the school district or to otherwise meet with any representatives of a school or a school district prior to the district school board deciding whether to give consent to the student. (C) Request any information used to supplement the information described in subsection (2) of this section prior to deciding whether to give consent to the student. (b) Nothing in this subsection prevents a student from voluntarily touring any of the schools or facilities of a school district or from requesting or receiving any information from a school or the school district. (4)(a) A district school board that gives consent as described in ORS 339.133 (5)(a) may limit the number of students to whom consent is given. The district school board must make the determination whether to limit the number of students to whom consent is given by an annual date established by the board. (b) If the number of students seeking consent exceeds any limitations imposed by the district school board, the board must give consent to students based on an equitable lottery selection process. The process may give priority to students who: (A) Have siblings currently enrolled in a school of the same school district for which the student seeks admission; (B) Previously had received consent as provided by subsection (10) of this section because of a change in legal residence; or (C) Attended a public charter school located in the same district for which the student seeks admission for at least three consecutive years, completed the highest grade offered by the public charter school and did not enroll in and attend school in another district following completion of the highest grade offered by the public charter school. (c) A district school board may revise the maximum number of students to whom consent will be given at a time other than the annual date established by the board if there are no pending applications for consent. (5) A district school board that is requested to give consent to allow a resident student to be admitted by another school district as described in ORS 339.133 (5)(a) may not consider race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity, national origin, disability, health, whether a student has an individualized education program, the terms of an individualized education program, income level, residence, proficiency in the English language, athletic ability or academic records when determining whether to give consent. (6) If a district school board decides to not give consent to a student, the board must provide a written explanation to the student. (7)(a) For a nonresident student who receives consent to be admitted to a school district as described in ORS 339.133 (5)(a), a district school board may: (A) Determine the length of time for which consent is given; and (B) Revoke consent for failure to comply with minimum standards for behavior or attendance, but may not revoke consent for failure to meet standards for academics. (b) Any limitations in length of time for consent, as allowed under paragraph (a) of this subsection, must be applied consistently among all students to whom consent is given. The length of time for which consent is given shall not be affected by any changes in the legal residence of the student if the student wishes to continue to attend the schools of the school district. (c) If consent is revoked as provided by paragraph (a) of this subsection, a student may not request consent from the same school district that revoked the consent for the school year following the school year in which the consent was revoked. (8) For a resident student who receives consent to be admitted to another school district as described in ORS 339.133 (5)(a), a district school board may not impose any limitations on the length of time for which consent is given to the student. The board may not require the student to receive consent more than one time to be admitted to the same school district, regardless of any time limitations imposed by the district school board under (7)(a)(A) of this section. (9)(a) A school district that provides consent to nonresident students to attend the schools of the school district may not expend moneys received from the State School Fund or as Local Revenues, as described in ORS 327.011, to advertise openings for nonresident students if the advertisements are: (A) Located outside the boundaries of the school district, including advertisements that are made by signage or billboards; or (B) Directed to nonresident students, including: (i) Advertisements that are targeted to nonresident students through direct mail or online marketing; (ii) Television or radio advertisements; or (iii) Newspaper advertisements, unless the advertisement is in a newspaper that primarily serves the residents of the school district. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(A) of this subsection, if a school is located outside the boundaries of the school district, the school district may advertise openings for nonresident students on the property of the school. (c) Nothing in this subsection: (A) Prohibits a school district from providing information or advertisements to nonresident students if the parents of the students request the information or advertisements. (B) Prohibits a public charter school from advertising openings. (10) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a district school board that is requested to give consent as described in ORS 339.133 (5)(a) must give consent to a student whose legal residence changes to a different school district: (a) During the school year, to enable the student to complete the school year in the school district; or (b) During the summer prior to the school year, to enable the student to complete the school year following the summer in the school district. (11) Nothing in this section: (a) Requires a district school board to admit students for whom priority may be given under subsection (4)(b) of this section if the board imposes limitations on the number of students admitted by consent. (b) Prevents a district school board from denying admission to a nonresident student as provided by ORS 339.115 (8). (c) Prevents a district school board from requesting information or giving consent to a student in the event of: (A) An emergency to protect the health, safety or welfare of the student; or (B) A hardship of the student, as determined based on rules adopted by the State Board of Education.

      "text": "(B) A law enforcement agency, the Department of Human Services or a designee of the department as required by ORS 419B.010 and 419B.015, for all reports of suspected abuse. (2) The licensed administrator who receives a report under subsection (1) of this section shall follow the procedures required by the policies adopted by the school board under ORS 339.372, including: (a) Notifying the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission as soon as possible of any reports of suspected sexual conduct that may have been committed by a person who is a commission licensee; and (b) Notifying the Department of Education as soon as possible of any reports of suspected sexual conduct that may have been committed by a person who is not a commission licensee. (3)(a) When a licensed administrator receives a report of suspected abuse or suspected sexual conduct by a school employee and there is reasonable cause to support the report, the education provider shall: (A) Place the school employee on paid administrative leave; and (B) Take necessary actions to ensure the students safety. (b) A school employee who is placed on paid administrative leave under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall remain on administrative leave until: (A) For a report of suspected abuse, a law enforcement agency or the Department of Human Services determines that the report: (i) Is substantiated and the education provider takes the appropriate employment action against the school employee; or (ii) Cannot be substantiated or is not a report of abuse and the education provider: (I) Determines that an employment policy has been violated and takes appropriate employment action against the school employee; or (II) Determines that an employment policy has not been violated and employment action against the school employee is not required. (B) For a report of suspected sexual conduct, the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission or the Department of Education determines that the report: (i) Is substantiated and the education provider takes the appropriate employment action against the school employee; or (ii) Cannot be substantiated or is not a report of sexual conduct and the education provider: (I) Determines that an employment policy has been violated and takes appropriate employment action against the school employee; or (II) Determines that an employment policy has not been violated and that employment action against the school employee is not required. (c) When a school employee is placed on paid administrative leave under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the education provider may not require the school employee to use any accrued leave during the paid administrative leave. (4)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, when a licensed administrator receives a report of suspected abuse or suspected sexual conduct by a contractor, an agent or a volunteer, the education provider: (A) May immediately prohibit the contractor, agent or volunteer from providing services to the education provider. (B) Shall prohibit the contractor, agent or volunteer from providing services to the education provider if the education provider determines that there is reasonable cause to support a report of abuse or sexual conduct. (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, an education provider is not required to reinstate a contractor, an agent or a volunteer. Any reinstatement of a contractor, an agent or a volunteer that does occur may not occur until: (A) For a report of suspected abuse, a law enforcement agency or the Department of Human Services determines that the report: (i) Is substantiated and the education provider takes the appropriate actions to protect students; or (ii) Cannot be substantiated or is not a report of abuse and the education provider: (I) Takes the appropriate actions to protect students; or (II) Determines that no other actions are required to protect students. (B) For a report of suspected sexual conduct, the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission or the Department of Education determines that the report: (i) Is substantiated and the education provider takes the appropriate actions to protect students; or (ii) Cannot be substantiated or is not a report of sexual conduct and the education provider: (I) Takes the appropriate actions to protect students; or (II) Determines that no other actions are required to protect students. (c) If a contract under which a contractor provides services to an education provider or an agreement under which an agent provides services to an education provider sets forth any negotiated standards for the relationship between the contractor or agent and the education provider, the education provider shall comply with those standards but may not in any instance grant the contractor or agent more rights than granted to a school employee under subsection (3) of this section. (d) Nothing in this subsection: (A) Establishes an employment relationship between an education provider and a contractor or an agent; or (B) Confers onto a contractor or an agent any rights of employment. (5)(a) When a report of suspected abuse or suspected sexual conduct is investigated by a law enforcement agency, the Department of Human Services, the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission or the Department of Education, an education provider may use the findings of the entity that conducted the investigation for the purpose of subsection (3) or (4) of this section and for making any determinations described in subsection (6) of this section. (b) Nothing in this subsection prohibits an education provider from: (A) Conducting an investigation related to a report of suspected abuse or suspected sexual conduct, except that the education provider must: (i) If requested, allow the investigation to be led by an entity identified in paragraph (a) of this subsection, as applicable; (ii) Follow any protocols and procedures of entities identified in paragraph (a) of this subsection that are involved in the investigation; and (iii) Cooperate with the entities identified in paragraph (a) of this subsection that are involved in the investigation, including by: (I) Suspending any investigations of the education provider at the request of the entity; and (II) Sharing information with the entity as provided by subsection (10) of this section. (B) Taking an employment action, based on information available to the education provider, before an investigation conducted by an entity identified in paragraph (a) of this subsection is completed. (6)(a) For each report of suspected abuse or suspected sexual conduct by a school employee, an education provider must determine if: (A) An employment policy of the education provider was violated; and (B) The education provider will take any employment actions, including disciplinary action against the school employee or changes to the employment relationship or duties of the school employee. (b) Determinations made under paragraph (a) of this subsection must be based on the findings of an investigation conducted by: (A) A law enforcement agency, the Department of Human Services, the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission or the Department of Education; or (B) The education provider, if the education provider conducts an investigation. (c) A final determination by a law enforcement agency, the Department of Human Services, the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission or the Department of Education that a report of suspected abuse or suspected sexual conduct cannot be substantiated or is not a report of abuse or sexual conduct does not: (A) Relieve an education provider of the requirement to make determinations under paragraph (a) of this subsection; or (B) Prohibit an education provider from taking any employment actions against a school employee. (d) Except as provided by paragraph (e) of this subsection, determinations made under paragraph (a) of this subsection must be made: (A) Within 60 calendar days from the date the education provider received from a law enforcement agency, the Department of Human Services, the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission or the Department of Education a final determination that a report of suspected abuse or suspected sexual conduct involving a school employee is a substantiated report; or (B) Within 90 calendar days from the date the education provider: (i) Received from a law enforcement agency, the Department of Human Services, the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission or the Department of Education a final determination that a report of suspected abuse or suspected sexual conduct involving a school employee cannot be substantiated or is not a report of abuse or sexual conduct; or (ii) Received a report of suspected abuse or suspected sexual conduct if the education provider conducts an investigation. (e) The timelines prescribed by paragraph (d) of this subsection may be extended if, for good cause, a longer period of time is necessary. For an education provider that conducts an investigation, good cause may include suspending an investigation as required by subsection (5)(b) of this section. (7) If, in the course of an investigation by an education provider, the education provider becomes aware of new information that gives rise to a reasonable cause to believe that abuse or sexual conduct occurred, the education provider shall ensure that a report is made to a law enforcement agency, the Department of Human Services, a designee of the department as required by ORS 419B.010 and 419B.015, the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission or the Department of Education. (8) If, following an investigation, an education provider determines that the education provider will take an employment action, the education provider shall: (a) Inform the school employee of the employment action that will be taken by the education provider. (b) Provide the school employee with information about the appropriate appeal process for the employment action taken by the education provider. The appeal process may be the process provided by a collective bargaining agreement or a process administered by a neutral third party and paid for by the education provider. (c) Following notice of a school employees decision not to appeal the employment action of an education provider or following the determination of an appeal that sustained the employment action taken by the education provider, create a record of the findings of the substantiated report and the employment action taken by the education provider and place the record in any documents maintained by the education provider on the school employee. Records created pursuant to this paragraph are confidential and are not public records as defined in ORS 192.311. An education provider may use the record as a basis for providing the information required to be disclosed about a school employee under ORS 339.378 (1). (d) Inform the school employee that information about substantiated reports may be disclosed to a potential employer as provided by ORS 339.378 (1). (9)(a) Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, an education provider that is a private school: (A) May take an employment action in relation to a school employee, a contractor, an agent or a volunteer according to: (i) The provisions of this section; or (ii) The standards and policies of the private school if the standards and policies provide the same or greater safeguards for the protection of students compared to the safeguards described in this section. (B) May follow the procedures described in subsection (8) of this section or may follow any appeals process established by the private school related to suspected abuse or suspected sexual conduct. (b) A private school that chooses to take an employment action or other action in relation to a school employee, a contractor, an agent or a volunteer according to the standards and policies of the private school must provide the information required to be disclosed under ORS 339.378 (1). (10) Upon request from a law enforcement agency, the Department of Human Services, the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission or the Department of Education, in conducting an investigation related to suspected abuse or suspected sexual conduct, an education provider shall immediately provide any requested documents or materials, to the extent allowed by state and federal law, including laws protecting a person from self-incrimination.",
