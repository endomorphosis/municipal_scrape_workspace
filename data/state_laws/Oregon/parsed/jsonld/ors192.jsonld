(b) The interest and concern of citizens in public records recognizes no jurisdictional boundaries and extends to such records wherever they may be found in Oregon. (c) As local programs become increasingly intergovernmental, the state and its political subdivisions have a responsibility to ensure orderly retention and destruction of all public records, whether current or noncurrent, and to ensure the preservation of public records of value for legal, administrative, fiscal, tribal cultural, historical or research purposes. (2) The purpose of ORS 192.005 to 192.170 and 357.805 to 357.895 is to provide direction for the retention or destruction of public records in Oregon in order to ensure the retention of records essential to meet the needs of the Legislative Assembly, the state, its political subdivisions and its citizens, insofar as the records affect the administration of government, legal rights and responsibilities, and the accumulation of information of value for research purposes of all kinds, and in order to ensure the prompt destruction of records without continuing value.

(1) A public body that is the custodian of any public record that a person has a right to inspect shall give the person, upon receipt of a written request: (a) A copy of the public record if the public record is of a nature permitting copying; or (b) A reasonable opportunity to inspect or copy the public record. (2) If an individual who is identified in a public bodys procedure described in subsection (7)(a) of this section receives a written request to inspect or receive a copy of a public record, the public body shall within five business days after receiving the request acknowledge receipt of the request or complete the public bodys response to the request. An acknowledgment under this subsection must: (a) Confirm that the public body is the custodian of the requested record; (b) Inform the requester that the public body is not the custodian of the requested record; or (c) Notify the requester that the public body is uncertain whether the public body is the custodian of the requested record. (3) If the public record is maintained in a machine readable or electronic form, the public body shall provide a copy of the public record in the form requested, if available. If the public record is not available in the form requested, the public body shall make the public record available in the form in which the public body maintains the public record. (4)(a) The public body may establish fees reasonably calculated to reimburse the public body for the public bodys actual cost of making public records available, including costs for summarizing, compiling or tailoring the public records, either in organization or media, to meet the request. (b) The public body may include in a fee established under paragraph (a) of this subsection the cost of time spent by an attorney for the public body in reviewing the public records, redacting material from the public records or segregating the public records into exempt and nonexempt records. The public body may not include in a fee established under paragraph (a) of this subsection the cost of time spent by an attorney for the public body in determining the application of the provisions of ORS 192.311 to 192.478. (c) The public body may not establish a fee greater than $25 under this section unless the public body first provides the requester with a written notification of the estimated amount of the fee and the requester confirms that the requester wants the public body to proceed with making the public record available. (d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subsection, when the public records are those filed with the Secretary of State under ORS chapter 79 or ORS 80.100 to 80.130, the fees for furnishing copies, summaries or compilations of the public records are the fees established by the Secretary of State by rule under ORS chapter 79 or ORS 80.100 to 80.130. (5) The custodian of a public record may furnish copies without charge or at a substantially reduced fee if the custodian determines that the waiver or reduction of fees is in the public interest because making the record available primarily benefits the general public. (6) A requester who believes that there has been an unreasonable denial of a fee waiver or fee reduction may petition the Attorney General or the district attorney in the same manner as a requester who petitions when inspection of a public record is denied under ORS 192.311 to 192.478. The Attorney General, the district attorney and the court have the same authority in instances when a fee waiver or reduction is denied as when inspection of a public record is denied. (7) A public body shall make available to the public a written procedure for making public records requests that includes: (a) The name of one or more individuals within the public body to whom public records requests may be sent, with addresses; and (b) The amounts of and the manner of calculating fees that the public body charges for responding to requests for public records. (8) This section does not apply to signatures of individuals submitted under ORS chapter 247 for purposes of registering to vote as provided in ORS 247.973. [Formerly 192.440]",

This exemption does not apply to litigation which has been concluded, and nothing in this subsection shall limit any right or opportunity granted by discovery or deposition statutes to a party to litigation or potential litigation. (2) Trade secrets. Trade secrets, as used in this section, may include, but are not limited to, any formula, plan, pattern, process, tool, mechanism, compound, procedure, production data, or compilation of information which is not patented, which is known only to certain individuals within an organization and which is used in a business it conducts, having actual or potential commercial value, and which gives its user an opportunity to obtain a business advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. (3) Investigatory information compiled for criminal law purposes. The record of an arrest or the report of a crime shall be disclosed unless and only for so long as there is a clear need to delay disclosure in the course of a specific investigation, including the need to protect the complaining party or the victim. Nothing in this subsection shall limit any right constitutionally guaranteed, or granted by statute, to disclosure or discovery in criminal cases. For purposes of this subsection, the record of an arrest or the report of a crime includes, but is not limited to: (a) The arrested persons name, age, residence, employment, marital status and similar biographical information; (b) The offense with which the arrested person is charged; (c) The conditions of release pursuant to ORS 135.230 to 135.290; (d) The identity of and biographical information concerning both complaining party and victim; (e) The identity of the investigating and arresting agency and the length of the investigation; (f) The circumstances of arrest, including time, place, resistance, pursuit and weapons used; and (g) Such information as may be necessary to enlist public assistance in apprehending fugitives from justice. (4) Test questions, scoring keys, and other data used to administer a licensing examination, employment, academic or other examination or testing procedure before the examination is given and if the examination is to be used again. Records establishing procedures for and instructing persons administering, grading or evaluating an examination or testing procedure are included in this exemption, to the extent that disclosure would create a risk that the result might be affected. (5) Information consisting of production records, sale or purchase records or catch records, or similar business records of a private concern or enterprise, required by law to be submitted to or inspected by a governmental body to allow it to determine fees or assessments payable or to establish production quotas, and the amounts of such fees or assessments payable or paid, to the extent that such information is in a form that would permit identification of the individual concern or enterprise. This exemption does not include records submitted by long term care facilities as defined in ORS 442.015 to the state for purposes of reimbursement of expenses or determining fees for patient care. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the use that can be made of such information for regulatory purposes or its admissibility in any enforcement proceeding. (6) Information relating to the appraisal of real estate prior to its acquisition. (7) The names and signatures of employees who sign authorization cards or petitions for the purpose of requesting representation or decertification elections. (8) Investigatory information relating to any complaint filed under ORS 659A.820 or 659A.825, until such time as the complaint is resolved under ORS 659A.835, or a final order is issued under ORS 659A.850.

(9) DNA sample means any human biological specimen that is obtained or retained for the purpose of extracting and analyzing DNA to perform a genetic test. DNA sample includes DNA extracted from the specimen. (10) Genetic characteristic includes a gene, chromosome or alteration thereof that may be tested to determine the existence or risk of a disease, disorder, trait, propensity or syndrome, or to identify an individual or a blood relative. Genetic characteristic does not include family history or a genetically transmitted characteristic whose existence or identity is determined other than through a genetic test. (11) Genetic information means information about an individual or the individuals blood relatives obtained from a genetic test. (12) Genetic privacy statutes means ORS 192.531 to 192.549, 659A.303 and 746.135 and the provisions of ORS 659A.300 relating to genetic testing. (13) Genetic research means research using DNA samples, genetic testing or genetic information. (14) Genetic test means a test for determining the presence or absence of genetic characteristics in an individual or the individuals blood relatives, including tests of nucleic acids such as DNA, RNA and mitochondrial DNA, chromosomes or proteins in order to diagnose or determine a genetic characteristic. (15) Health care provider has the meaning given that term in ORS 192.556. (16) Identifiable means capable of being linked to the individual or a blood relative of the individual from whom the DNA sample or genetic information was obtained. (17) Identified means having an identifier that links, or that could readily allow the recipient to link, a DNA sample or genetic information directly to the individual or a blood relative of the individual from whom the sample or information was obtained. (18) Identifier means data elements that directly link a DNA sample or genetic information to the individual or a blood relative of the individual from whom the sample or information was obtained.

      "text": "(1) The Legislative Assembly finds that: (a) The DNA molecule contains information about the probable medical future of an individual and the individuals blood relatives. This information is written in a code that is rapidly being broken. (b) Genetic information is uniquely private and personal information that generally should not be collected, retained or disclosed without the individuals authorization. (c) The improper collection, retention or disclosure of genetic information can lead to significant harm to an individual and the individuals blood relatives, including stigmatization and discrimination in areas such as employment, education, health care and insurance. (d) An analysis of an individuals DNA provides information not only about the individual, but also about blood relatives of the individual, with the potential for impacting family privacy, including reproductive decisions. (e) Current legal protections for medical information, tissue samples and DNA samples are inadequate to protect genetic privacy. (f) Laws for the collection, storage and use of identifiable DNA samples and private genetic information obtained from those samples are needed both to protect individual and family privacy and to permit and encourage legitimate scientific and medical research. (2) The purposes of the genetic privacy statutes are as follows: (a) To define the rights of individuals whose genetic information is collected, retained or disclosed and the rights of the individuals blood relatives. (b) To define the circumstances under which an individual may be subjected to genetic testing. (c) To define the circumstances under which an individuals genetic information may be collected, retained or disclosed. (d) To protect against discrimination by an insurer or employer based upon an individuals genetic characteristics. (e) To define the circumstances under which a DNA sample or genetic information may be used for research. [Formerly 659.705; 2003 c.333 2] Note: See note under 192.531.",

Rules establishing minimum research standards shall conform to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects, 45 C.F.R. 46, that is current at the time the rules are adopted. The rules may be changed from time to time as may be necessary. (b) The rules adopted by the Oregon Health Authority shall address the operation and appointment of institutional review boards. The rules shall conform to the compositional and operational standards for such boards contained in the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects that is current at the time the rules are adopted. The rules must require that research conducted under paragraph (a) of this subsection be conducted with the approval of the institutional review board. (c) Persons proposing to conduct anonymous research, coded research or genetic research that is otherwise thought to be exempt from review must obtain from an institutional review board prior to conducting such research a determination that the proposed research is exempt from review. (2) A person proposing to conduct research under subsection (1) of this section, including anonymous research or coded research, must disclose to the institutional review board the proposed use of DNA samples, genetic testing or genetic information. (3) The Oregon Health Authority shall adopt rules requiring that all institutional review boards operating under subsection (1)(b) of this section register with the department. The Advisory Committee on Genetic Privacy and Research shall use the registry to educate institutional review boards about the purposes and requirements of the genetic privacy statutes and administrative rules relating to genetic research. (4) The Oregon Health Authority shall consult with the Advisory Committee on Genetic Privacy and Research before adopting the rules required under subsections (1) and (3) of this section, including rules identifying those parts of the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects that are applicable to this section. (5) Genetic research in which the DNA sample or genetic information is coded shall satisfy the following requirements: (a)(A) The subject has granted informed consent for the specific research project; (B) The subject has consented to genetic research generally; or (C) The DNA sample or genetic information is derived from a biological specimen or from clinical individually identifiable health information that was obtained or retained in compliance with ORS 192.537 (2). (b) The research has been approved by an institutional review board after disclosure by the investigator to the board of risks associated with the coding. (c) The code is: (A) Not derived from individual identifiers; (B) Kept securely and separately from the DNA samples and genetic information; and (C) Not accessible to the investigator unless specifically approved by the institutional review board. (d) Data is stored securely in password protected electronic files or by other means with access limited to necessary personnel. (e) The data is limited to elements required for analysis and meets the criteria in 45 C.F.R 164.514(e) for a limited data set. (f) The investigator is a party to the data use agreement as provided by 45 C.F.R. 164.514(e) for limited data set recipients. (6) Research conducted in accordance with this section is rebuttably presumed to comply with ORS 192.535 and 192.539. (7)(a) Notwithstanding ORS 192.535, a person may use a DNA sample or genetic information obtained, with blanket informed consent, before June 25, 2001, for genetic research. (b) Notwithstanding ORS 192.535, a person may use a DNA sample or genetic information obtained without specific informed consent and derived from a biological specimen or clinical individually identifiable health information for anonymous research or coded research if an institutional review board operating under subsection (1)(b) of this section: (A) Waives or alters the consent requirements pursuant to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects; and (B) Waives authorization pursuant to the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act privacy regulations, 45 C.F.R. parts 160 and 164.

(6) A financial institution that provides copies of financial records under this section may be reimbursed for costs incurred as provided in ORS 192.602. (7)(a) Financial records may be subpoenaed under this section only with respect to a person who is the alleged victim of abuse in an investigation under ORS 124.070 or 441.650. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, financial records may be subpoenaed under this section when the financial records pertain to an account, loan or other financial relationship owned, held or maintained by a person who is the alleged victim in an abuse investigation under ORS 124.070 or 441.650 together with one or more other persons who are not alleged victims in the abuse investigation. (8) A financial institution that discloses and provides copies of financial records under this section is not liable to any person for any loss, damage or injury arising out of or in any way pertaining to the disclosure and provision of the copies.

(2) A quorum of a governing body may not meet in private for the purpose of deciding on or deliberating toward a decision on any matter except as otherwise provided by ORS 192.610 to 192.705. (3) A governing body may not hold a meeting at any place where discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age or disability is practiced. However, the fact that organizations with restricted membership hold meetings at the place does not restrict its use by a public body if use of the place by a restricted membership organization is not the primary purpose of the place or its predominant use.

For purposes of this subparagraph, Indian country has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. 1151.

(d) Meetings may be held in locations other than those described in this subsection in the event of an actual emergency necessitating immediate action. (5)(a) It is discrimination on the basis of disability for a governing body of a public body to meet in a place inaccessible to persons with disabilities, or, upon request of a person who is deaf or hard of hearing, to fail to make a good faith effort to have an interpreter for persons who are deaf or hard of hearing provided at a regularly scheduled meeting. The sole remedy for discrimination on the basis of disability shall be as provided in ORS 192.680. (b) The person requesting the interpreter shall give the governing body at least 48 hours notice of the request for an interpreter, shall provide the name of the requester, sign language preference and any other relevant information the governing body may request. (c) If a meeting is held upon less than 48 hours notice, reasonable effort shall be made to have an interpreter present, but the requirement for an interpreter does not apply to emergency meetings. (d) If certification of interpreters occurs under state or federal law, the Oregon Health Authority or other state or local agency shall try to refer only certified interpreters to governing bodies for purposes of this subsection. (e) As used in this subsection, good faith effort includes, but is not limited to, contacting the department or other state or local agency that maintains a list of qualified interpreters and arranging for the referral of one or more qualified interpreters to provide interpreter services.",
