The personal representative shall request and the court shall allow a longer time for ascertaining claims if the personal representative cannot complete reasonably diligent efforts to identify persons with claims during the time required by this section or by a previous order of the court. (2) Not later than 30 days after expiration of the period, including any extensions, described in subsection (1) or (6) of this section, the personal representative shall cause to be delivered or mailed to each person known by the personal representative during such period to have or assert a claim against the estate a notice containing the information required in subsection (3) of this section. The personal representative is not required to give notice on account of a claim that has already been presented, accepted or paid in full or on account of a claim that is merely conjectural.

(b) In addition to the addresses for the presentation of claims under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the personal representative may authorize creditors to present claims by electronic mail or facsimile communication to a designated electronic mail address or facsimile number. If the personal representative authorizes alternative methods of presentation under this subsection, a claim is presented to the personal representative when it is sent to the electronic mail address or the facsimile number designated by the personal representative for the presentation of claims, unless the sender receives a notice that the electronic mail was not delivered or the facsimile communication was not successful. If the personal representative denies receiving the electronic mail or facsimile communication, the burden of proof is on the creditor to demonstrate that the electronic mail was properly addressed and sent or that the facsimile communication was properly addressed and successfully delivered or transmitted. (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a claim is barred from payment from the estate if not presented within the statute of limitations applicable to the claim and before the later of: (a) Four months after the date of publication of notice to interested persons; or (b) If the claim was one with respect to which the personal representative was required to deliver or mail a notice under ORS 115.003 (2), 45 days after a notice meeting the requirements of ORS 115.003 (3) is delivered or mailed to the last-known address of the person asserting the claim. (3) A claim against the estate presented after claims are barred under subsection (2) of this section shall be paid from the estate if the claim: (a) Is presented before the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the claim and before the personal representative files the final account; (b) Is presented by a person who did not receive a notice under ORS 115.003 mailed or delivered more than 30 days prior to the date on which the claim is presented and who is not an assignee of a person who received such notice; and (c) Would be allowable but for the time at which the claim is presented. (4) A claim against an estate may be paid under subsection (3) of this section only after payment of all expenses having priority over claims under ORS 115.125 and payment of all previously presented claims. (5) This section does not affect or prevent: (a) Any proceeding to enforce a mortgage, pledge or other lien upon property of the estate, or to quiet title or reform any instrument with respect to title to property; or (b) To the limits of the insurance protection only, any proceeding to establish liability of the decedent or the personal representative for which the decedent or personal representative is protected by liability insurance at the time the proceeding is commenced.
