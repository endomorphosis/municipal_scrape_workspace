(1) The dissolution of a soil and water conservation district may be initiated by any of the following methods: (a) A petition by 500 electors or 10 percent of the electors within the district, whichever is less, filed with the State Department of Agriculture. (b) A resolution of the district board of directors filed with the department. The district board may adopt a resolution described in this paragraph only if the board finds that dissolution and liquidation of the district is in the public interest. (c) District board notification to the department that the board is unable to maintain a quorum of directors or that the district is unable to satisfy the legal obligations and liabilities of the district. (d) An order of the department, if the department determines that the district is inactive, that the district board is unable to maintain a quorum of directors or that the district is unable to satisfy the legal obligations and liabilities of the district. (2) The department shall prescribe the form for a petition for dissolution. The petition must include, but need not be limited to, a legal description of the district, name and contact information for the chief petitioner and the reasons for the proposed dissolution. No later than 60 days after receiving the petition, the department shall verify the petition signatures. (3) Upon the initiation of a dissolution by any method, the department shall provide the district with written notice that the dissolution process has been initiated and shall request information from the district board for use in public meetings and public hearings. (4) No later than 60 days after receiving a written request for information from the department, the district board shall provide the department with the requested information and a plan of dissolution and liquidation for the district. The information and plan shall include, at a minimum: (a) The amount of district debt, a general description of the indebtedness and the names and contact information for persons owed, including but not limited to, payroll and other accrued liabilities; (b) A brief description of the districts real property and interests in real property; (c) A description of conservation easements held by the district; (d) A description of the uncollected taxes, assessments and charges levied by the district; (e) A description of personal property and other assets of the district; (f) The estimated cost of dissolution; and (g) A general description of all district contracts, grants and agreements, a description of receivables and payables for each contract, grant and agreement and a description of the work or other obligations remaining on each contract, grant or agreement. (5) If the district is within the jurisdiction of a local government boundary commission, no later than 10 days after the district board provides the plan of dissolution and liquidation to the department, the district board shall provide a copy of the plan to the boundary commission. (6) The department shall have full access to district records. If the district is unable to prepare a plan of dissolution and liquidation, the department shall review the district records and prepare the plan. (7) The department shall conduct public meetings and public hearings as necessary to present the plan of dissolution and liquidation and to aid in the consideration of dissolution. (8) If the dissolution is initiated by petition, the department may order the district dissolved without a referendum election if: (a) No later than 60 days after the department receives the petition, the district board adopts a resolution to dissolve the district and the department determines that dissolution of the district is in the public interest; or (b) No later than 60 days after holding a public hearing regarding dissolution of the district, the department finds that the district board is unable to maintain a quorum of directors or that the district is unable to satisfy the legal obligations and liabilities of the district. (9) Except as provided in subsection (8) of this section, if the dissolution is initiated by petition, after holding a public hearing and giving notice of a referendum election, the department shall hold an election. The election shall be for the purpose of submitting to the electors of the district the question of whether the district should be dissolved, the indebtedness of the district liquidated and district assets disposed of, as provided under the plan for dissolution and liquidation. The election shall be held on the next special election date described in ORS 255.345 for which the filing deadline can be met. However, an election may not be held unless the department has: (a) Made provision for the district to pay to the department, to the extent practicable, the cost of the referendum; and (b)(A) Obtained assent to the dissolution and liquidation from all known holders of a valid indebtedness against the district; or (B) Made provision in the plan of dissolution and liquidation for the payment of nonassenting holders. (10) The notice of election must contain a brief summary of the plan of dissolution and liquidation and state that the plan is available for examination at the office of the county clerk. Only electors residing in the district are eligible to cast ballots in the referendum election. An informality in the conducting of the referendum election, or in matters regarding the election, does not invalidate the election or results if notice of the election was given in substantial compliance with this section and the election was fairly conducted. (11) If a majority of the ballots cast at the referendum election are in favor of dissolution, the department shall approve the petition and order dissolution of the district.

If the moneys are offset as provided under this paragraph, the moneys shall be distributed to each taxing unit in the amount of that taxing units offset. (b) The amount may be credited to each property appearing on the tax roll for the year for which the credit applies within the dissolved district on the basis of current assessed value. If the certified moneys are distributed under this paragraph, the moneys shall be deposited in the unsegregated tax collections account established under ORS 311.385 and distributed in the same manner as other moneys in that account. The Department of Revenue shall adopt rules further defining the method to be used to credit the amount. (3) If a district that is being dissolved does not have tax levying authority, the board of trustees shall turn over to the State Department of Agriculture any surplus moneys remaining to the credit of the district after payment of the indebtedness of the district. If the assets of the district are insufficient to pay the indebtedness, the board of trustees shall determine whether any of the indebtedness is given priority by law over other indebtedness. The board of trustees shall apply the assets of the district first to the payment of indebtedness that is given priority by law over other indebtedness. If any assets remain after the payment of indebtedness that is given priority by law, the board of trustees shall apply the assets to the payment of a uniform percentage of each remaining indebtedness. (4) The board of trustees may transfer any district assets, other than moneys, available after the payment of all district indebtedness to the State Department of Agriculture or to another soil and water conservation district.",

(8) A director position becomes vacant under the following circumstances: (a) The department, upon the written recommendation of a majority of the members of the local governing body of a district, may declare vacant the position of a director who is absent from three consecutive meetings of the local governing body of the district. A position becomes vacant under this paragraph upon the issuance of the declaration by the department. (b) No nominee for the position qualifies under ORS 568.530 to have the name of the nominee furnished to the county clerk for placement on the general district election ballot and no person qualifies under ORS 568.530 to have write-in votes counted. A position becomes vacant under this paragraph on January 1. (c) The department determines that a candidate receiving the most votes at an election does not qualify under this section to hold the position. A position becomes vacant under this paragraph on January 1 next following the election at which the unqualified candidate was elected unless an appointee to the position has been selected under subsection (9) of this section. (d) A director serving in a position no longer qualifies under this section to hold the position. A position becomes vacant under this paragraph upon the departments declaration that the person no longer qualifies for the position. (e) A director resigns from a position. A position becomes vacant under this paragraph upon the departments receiving notice of the resignation. (f) A candidate who received the most votes at an election, or an appointee, refuses to take the oath of office as a director. (9) A director position that becomes vacant before the scheduled expiration of a term shall be filled by appointment by a majority of the remaining directors. However, if a majority of the director positions are vacant or if the remaining directors cannot agree on an appointee, the department shall make an appointment to fill the position. (10) An appointment under subsection (9) of this section shall end on January 1 next following the first general district election held after the appointment. If the appointment ends under this subsection before the January 1 that would normally complete the four-year term of office for the position, the position shall be placed on the ballot at the next general election as provided under ORS 568.530 to fill the position for the remainder of the four-year term.",
