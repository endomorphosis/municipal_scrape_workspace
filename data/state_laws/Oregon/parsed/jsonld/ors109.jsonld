(b) Foreign country means any country that: (A) Is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction; (B) Does not provide for the extradition to the United States of a parental abductor and minor child; (C) Has local laws or practices that would restrict the other parent of the minor child from freely traveling to or exiting from the country because of the race, religion, sex, sexual orientation or gender identity of the other parent; (D) Has local laws or practices that would restrict the ability of the minor child from legally leaving the country after the child reaches the age of majority because of the race, religion, sex, sexual orientation or gender identity of the child; or (E) Poses a significant risk that the physical health or safety of the minor child would be endangered in the country because of war, human rights violations or specific circumstances related to the needs of the child. (2) A court that finds by clear and convincing evidence a risk of international abduction of a minor child may issue a court order requiring a parent who is subject to a custody order and who plans to travel with a minor child to a foreign country to provide security, bond or other guarantee as described in subsection (4) of this section. (3) In determining whether a risk of international abduction of a minor child exists, a court shall consider the following factors involving a parent who is subject to a custody order: (a) The parent has taken or retained, attempted to take or retain or threatened to take or retain a minor child in violation of state law or a valid custody order and the parent is unable to present clear and convincing evidence that the parent believed in good faith that the conduct was necessary to avoid imminent harm to the parent or the child; (b) The parent has recently engaged in a pattern of activities that indicates the parent is planning to abduct the minor child from this country; (c) The parent has strong familial, emotional or cultural connections to this country or another country, regardless of citizenship or residency status; and (d) Any other relevant factors. (4) A security, bond or other guarantee required by a court under this section may include, but is not limited to, any of the following: (a) A bond or security deposit in an amount that is sufficient to offset the cost of recovering the minor child if the child is abducted; (b) Supervised parenting time; or (c) Passport and travel controls, including but not limited to controls that: (A) Prohibit the parent from removing the minor child from this state or this country; (B) Require the parent to surrender a passport or an international travel visa that is issued in the name of the minor child or jointly in the names of the parent and the child; (C) Prohibit the parent from applying for a new or replacement passport or international travel visa on behalf of the minor child; and (D) Require the parent to provide to a relevant embassy or consulate and to the Office of Childrens Issues in the United States Department of State the following documents: (i) Written notice of passport and travel controls required under this paragraph; and (ii) A certified copy of a court order issued under this section. (5) After considering the factors under subsection (3) of this section and requiring a security, bond or other guarantee under this section, the court shall issue a written determination supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law. (6) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the inherent power of a court in matters relating to children. [2003 c.532 1; 2005 c.22 85; 2007 c.100 17; 2021 c.367 7] Note:",

      "text": "Presumption of parentage; establishing paternity by voluntary acknowledgment. (1) The parentage of a person is rebuttably presumed if: (a) The person is married to the birth mother at the time of the childs birth, without a judgment of separation, regardless of whether the marriage is void. (b) The person is married to the birth mother and the child is born within 300 days after the marriage is terminated by death, annulment or dissolution or after entry of a judgment of separation. (2) The parentage of a child established under subsection (1)(a) or (4)(a) of this section may be challenged in an action or proceeding by either spouse. The parentage may not be challenged by a person other than a spouse as long as the spouses are married and are cohabiting, unless both spouses consent to the challenge. (3) If the court finds that it is just and equitable, giving consideration to the interests of the parties and the child, the court shall admit evidence offered to rebut the presumption of parentage in subsection (1) of this section. (4) The paternity of a person may be established by a voluntary acknowledgment as follows: (a) By the marriage of the parents of a child after the birth of the child, and the parents filing with the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form as provided by ORS 432.098. (b) By filing with the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form as provided under ORS 432.098. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (5) and (8) of this section, a filing under this paragraph establishes paternity for all purposes. (c) By establishment of paternity through a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity in another state. (5)(a) A party to a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity may rescind the acknowledgment within the earlier of: (A) Sixty days after filing the acknowledgment; or (B) The date of a proceeding relating to the child, including a proceeding to establish a support order, in which the party wishing to rescind the acknowledgment is also a party. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the date of a proceeding is the date on which an order is entered in the proceeding. (b) To rescind the acknowledgment, the party shall sign and file with the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics a written document declaring the rescission. (6)(a) A signed voluntary acknowledgment of paternity filed in this state may be challenged and set aside in circuit court at any time after the 60-day period referred to in subsection (5) of this section on the basis of fraud, duress or a material mistake of fact. (b) The challenge may be brought by: (A) A party to the acknowledgment; (B) The child named in the acknowledgment; or (C) The Department of Human Services or the administrator, as defined in ORS 25.010, if the child named in the acknowledgment is in the care and custody of the department under ORS chapter 419B and the department or the administrator reasonably believes that the acknowledgment was signed because of fraud, duress or a material mistake of fact. (c) The challenge shall be initiated by filing a petition with the circuit court. Unless otherwise specifically provided by law, the challenge shall be conducted pursuant to the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure. (d) The party bringing the challenge has the burden of proof. (e) Legal responsibilities arising from the acknowledgment, including child support obligations, may not be suspended during the challenge, except for good cause. (f) If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the acknowledgment was signed because of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact, the court shall set aside the acknowledgment unless, giving consideration to the interests of the parties and the child, the court finds that setting aside the acknowledgment would be substantially inequitable. (7) Within one year after a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form is filed in this state and if blood tests, as defined in ORS 109.251, have not been completed, a party to the acknowledgment, or the department if the child named in the acknowledgment is in the care and custody of the department under ORS chapter 419B, may apply to the administrator for an order for blood tests in accordance with ORS 25.554. (8)(a) A voluntary acknowledgment of paternity is not valid if, before the party signed the acknowledgment: (A) The party signed a consent to the adoption of the child by another individual; (B) The party signed a document relinquishing the child to a child-caring agency as defined in ORS 418.205; (C) The partys parental rights were terminated by a court; or (D) In an adjudication, the party was determined not to be the biological parent of the child. (b) Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (4)(a) or (b) of this section or ORS 432.098 to the contrary, an acknowledgment signed by a party described in this subsection and filed with the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics does not establish paternity and is void.",

(B) Parentage judgment does not include a judgment or administrative order that determines paternity or parentage of a child conceived by assisted reproduction as defined in ORS 109.239. (c) Petition means a petition or motion filed under this section. (d) Petitioner means the person filing a petition or motion under this section. (2)(a) The following may file in circuit court a petition to vacate or set aside the parentage determination of a parentage judgment, including any child support obligations established in the parentage judgment, and for a judgment of nonparentage: (A) A party to the parentage judgment. (B) The Department of Human Services if the child is in the care and custody of the Department of Human Services under ORS chapter 419B. (C) The Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice if the child support rights of the child or of one of the parties to the parentage judgment have been assigned to the state. (b) The petitioner may file the petition in the circuit court proceeding in which the parentage judgment was entered, in a related proceeding or in a separate action. The petitioner shall attach a copy of the parentage judgment to the petition. (c) If the ground for the petition is that the parentage determination was obtained by or was the result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect, the petitioner may not file the petition more than one year after entry of the parentage judgment. (d) If the ground for the petition is that the parentage determination was obtained by or was the result of fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct of an adverse party, the petitioner may not file the petition more than one year after the petitioner discovers the fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct. (3) In the petition, the petitioner shall: (a) Designate as parties: (A) All persons who were parties to the parentage judgment; (B) The child if the child is a child attending school, as defined in ORS 107.108; (C) The Department of Human Services if the child is in the care and custody of the Department of Human Services under ORS chapter 419B; and (D) The Administrator of the Division of Child Support of the Department of Justice if the child support rights of the child or of one of the parties to the parentage judgment have been assigned to the state. (b) Provide the full name and date of birth of the child whose parentage was determined by the parentage judgment. (c) Allege the facts and circumstances that resulted in the entry of the parentage judgment and explain why the issue of parentage was not contested. (4) After filing a petition under this section, the petitioner shall serve a summons and a true copy of the petition on all parties as provided in ORCP 7. (5) The court, on its own motion or on the motion of a party, may appoint counsel for the child. However, if requested to do so by the child, the court shall appoint counsel for the child. A reasonable fee for an attorney so appointed may be charged against one or more of the parties or as a cost in the proceeding, but may not be charged against funds appropriated for public defense services. (6) The court may order the mother, the child and the person whose parentage of the child was determined by the parentage judgment to submit to blood tests. In deciding whether to order blood tests, the court shall consider the interests of the parties and the child and, if it is just and equitable to do so, may deny a request for blood tests. If the court orders blood tests under this subsection, the court shall order the petitioner to pay the costs of the blood tests. (7) Unless the court finds, giving consideration to the interests of the parties and the child, that to do so would be substantially inequitable, the court shall vacate or set aside the parentage determination of the parentage judgment, including provisions imposing child support obligations, and enter a judgment of nonparentage if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that: (a) The parentage determination was obtained by or was the result of: (A) Mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect; or (B) Fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct of an adverse party; (b) The mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct was discovered by the petitioner after the entry of the parentage judgment; and (c)(A) Blood tests establish that the person is not the biological parent of the child and the parentage determination was based on biological parentage; or (B) The parentage determination was not based on biological parentage. (8) If the court finds that the parentage determination of a parentage judgment was obtained by or was the result of fraud, the court may vacate or set aside the parentage determination regardless of whether the fraud was intrinsic or extrinsic. (9) If the court finds, based on blood test evidence, that the person may be the biological parent of the child and that the cumulative paternity or parentage index based on the blood test evidence is 99 or greater, the court shall deny the petition. (10) The court may grant the relief authorized by this section upon a partys default, or by consent or stipulation of the parties, without blood test evidence. (11) A judgment entered under this section vacating or setting aside the parentage determination of a parentage judgment and determining nonparentage: (a) Shall contain the full name and date of birth of the child whose parentage was established or declared by the parentage judgment. (b) Shall vacate and terminate any ongoing and future child support obligations arising from or based on the parentage judgment. (c) May vacate or deem as satisfied, in whole or in part, unpaid child support obligations arising from or based on the parentage judgment. (d) May not order restitution from the state for any sums paid to or collected by the state for the benefit of the child. (12) If the court vacates or sets aside the parentage determination of a parentage judgment under this section and enters a judgment of nonparentage, the petitioner shall send a court-certified true copy of the judgment entered under this section to the State Registrar of the Center for Health Statistics and to the Department of Justice as the state disbursement unit. Upon receipt of the court-certified true copy of the judgment entered under this section, the state registrar shall correct any records maintained by the state registrar that indicate that the party to the parentage judgment is the parent of the child. (13) The court may award to the prevailing party a judgment for reasonable attorney fees and costs, including the cost of any blood tests ordered by the court and paid by the prevailing party. (14) A judgment entered under this section vacating or setting aside the parentage determination of a parentage judgment and determining nonparentage is not a bar to further proceedings to determine parentage, as otherwise allowed by law. (15) If a person whose parentage of a child has been determined by a parentage judgment has died, an action under this section may not be initiated by or on behalf of the estate of the person. (16) This section does not limit the authority of the court to vacate or set aside a judgment under ORCP 71, to modify a judgment within a reasonable period, to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, to vacate or set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court or to render a declaratory judgment under ORS chapter 28. (17) This section shall be liberally construed to the end of achieving substantial justice. [2007 c.454 9; 2017 c.651 16] Note:",

(2) Except as provided in subsection (3) or (4) of this section, a verified statement of the mother of the child or of the petitioner, or an affidavit of another person with knowledge of the facts, filed in the proceeding and asserting that the child has not resided with the putative father, as provided in subsection (1)(a) of this section, and that the putative father has not contributed or tried to contribute to the support of the child, as provided in subsection (1)(b) of this section, is sufficient proof to enable the court to grant the relief sought without notice to the putative father. (3) The putative father is entitled to reasonable notice in a proceeding for the adoption of the child if notice of the initiation of filiation proceedings as required by ORS 109.225 is on file with the Center for Health Statistics of the Oregon Health Authority prior to the childs being placed in the physical custody of a person or persons for the purpose of adoption by them. If the notice of the initiation of filiation proceedings is not on file at the time of the placement, the putative father is barred from contesting the adoption proceeding. (4) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, the putative father is entitled to reasonable notice in court proceedings concerning the custody of the child, other than juvenile court proceedings, if notice of the initiation of filiation proceedings as required by ORS 109.225 is on file with the Center for Health Statistics prior to the initiation of the proceedings. (5) Notice under this section is not required to be given to a putative father who was a party to a filiation proceeding under ORS 109.125 or to a proceeding to acknowledge or establish parentage of an Indian child under ORS 419B.609 if the proceeding under ORS 109.125 or 419B.609 was dismissed or resulted in a finding that the putative father was not the father of the child. (6) The notice required under this section shall be given in the manner provided in ORS 109.330. (7) No notice given under this section need disclose the name of the mother of the child. (8) A putative father has the primary responsibility to protect his rights, and nothing in this section shall be used to set aside an act of a permanent nature including, but not limited to, adoption or termination of parental rights, unless the father establishes within one year after the entry of the final judgment or order fraud on the part of a petitioner in the proceeding with respect to matters specified in subsections (1) to (5) of this section.",

      "text": "Rights of person who establishes emotional ties creating child-parent relationship or ongoing personal relationship; presumption regarding legal parent; motion for intervention. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (9) of this section, any person, including but not limited to a related or nonrelated foster parent, stepparent, grandparent or relative by blood or marriage, who has established emotional ties creating a child-parent relationship or an ongoing personal relationship with a child may petition or file a motion for intervention with the court having jurisdiction over the custody, placement or guardianship of that child, or if no such proceedings are pending, may petition the court for the county in which the child resides, for an order providing for relief under subsection (3) of this section. (2)(a) In any proceeding under this section, there is a presumption that the legal parent acts in the best interest of the child. (b) In an order granting relief under this section, the court shall include findings of fact supporting the rebuttal of the presumption described in paragraph (a) of this subsection. (c) The presumption described in paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply in a proceeding to modify an order granting relief under this section. (3)(a) If the court determines that a child-parent relationship exists and if the court determines that the presumption described in subsection (2)(a) of this section has been rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence, the court shall grant custody, guardianship, right of visitation or other right to the person having the child-parent relationship, if to do so is in the best interest of the child. The court may determine temporary custody of the child or temporary visitation rights under this paragraph pending a final order. (b) If the court determines that an ongoing personal relationship exists and if the court determines that the presumption described in subsection (2)(a) of this section has been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, the court shall grant visitation or contact rights to the person having the ongoing personal relationship, if to do so is in the best interest of the child. The court may order temporary visitation or contact rights under this paragraph pending a final order. (4)(a) In deciding whether the presumption described in subsection (2)(a) of this section has been rebutted and whether to award visitation or contact rights over the objection of the legal parent, the court may consider factors including, but not limited to, the following, which may be shown by the evidence: (A) The petitioner or intervenor is or recently has been the childs primary caretaker; (B) Circumstances detrimental to the child exist if relief is denied; (C) The legal parent has fostered, encouraged or consented to the relationship between the child and the petitioner or intervenor; (D) Granting relief would not substantially interfere with the custodial relationship; or (E) The legal parent has unreasonably denied or limited contact between the child and the petitioner or intervenor. (b) In deciding whether the presumption described in subsection (2)(a) of this section has been rebutted and whether to award custody, guardianship or other rights over the objection of the legal parent, the court may consider factors including, but not limited to, the following, which may be shown by the evidence: (A) The legal parent is unwilling or unable to care adequately for the child; (B) The petitioner or intervenor is or recently has been the childs primary caretaker; (C) Circumstances detrimental to the child exist if relief is denied; (D) The legal parent has fostered, encouraged or consented to the relationship between the child and the petitioner or intervenor; or (E) The legal parent has unreasonably denied or limited contact between the child and the petitioner or intervenor. (5) In addition to the other rights granted under this section, a stepparent with a child-parent relationship who is a party in a dissolution proceeding may petition the court having jurisdiction for custody or visitation under this section or may petition the court for the county in which the child resides for adoption of the child. The stepparent may also file for post-judgment modification of a judgment relating to child custody. (6)(a) A motion for intervention filed under this section shall comply with ORCP 33 and state the grounds for relief under this section. (b) Costs for the representation of an intervenor under this section may not be charged against funds appropriated for public defense services. (7) In a proceeding under this section, the court may: (a) Cause an investigation, examination or evaluation to be made under ORS 107.425 or may appoint an individual or a panel or may designate a program to assist the court in creating parenting plans or resolving disputes regarding parenting time and to assist the parties in creating and implementing parenting plans under ORS 107.425 (3). (b) Assess against a party reasonable attorney fees and costs for the benefit of another party. (8) When a petition or motion to intervene is filed under this section seeking guardianship or custody of a child who is a foreign national, the petitioner or intervenor shall serve a copy of the petition or motion on the consulate for the childs country. (9) This section does not apply to proceedings under ORS chapter 419B. (10) As used in this section: (a) Child-parent relationship means a relationship that exists or did exist, in whole or in part, within the six months preceding the filing of an action under this section, and in which relationship a person having physical custody of a child or residing in the same household as the child supplied, or otherwise made available to the child, food, clothing, shelter and incidental necessaries and provided the child with necessary care, education and discipline, and which relationship continued on a day-to-day basis, through interaction, companionship, interplay and mutuality, that fulfilled the childs psychological needs for a parent as well as the childs physical needs. However, a relationship between a child and a person who is the nonrelated foster parent of the child is not a child-parent relationship under this section unless the relationship continued over a period exceeding 12 months. (b) Circumstances detrimental to the child includes but is not limited to circumstances that may cause psychological, emotional or physical harm to a child. (c) Grandparent means the legal parent of the childs legal parent. (d) Legal parent means a parent as defined in ORS 419A.004 whose rights have not been terminated under ORS 419B.500 to 419B.524. (e) Ongoing personal relationship means a relationship with substantial continuity for at least one year, through interaction, companionship, interplay and mutuality.",

If the parentage is denied, corroborating evidence, in addition to the testimony of the parent or expectant parent, shall be required. (2) If the court finds, from a preponderance of the evidence, that the petitioner or the respondent is the father of the child who has been, or who may be born out of wedlock, the court shall then proceed to a determination of the appropriate relief to be granted. The court may approve any settlement agreement reached between the parties and incorporate the agreement into any judgment rendered, and the court may order such investigation or the production of such evidence as the court deems appropriate to establish a proper basis for relief. (3) The court, in its discretion, may postpone the hearing from time to time to facilitate any investigation or the production of such evidence as it deems appropriate. (4) The court may order either parent to pay such sum as the court deems appropriate for the past and future support and maintenance of the child during the childs minority and while the child is attending school, as defined in ORS 107.108, and the reasonable and necessary expenses incurred or to be incurred in connection with prenatal care, expenses attendant with the birth and postnatal care.

(5) An affidavit certifying the authenticity of documents substantiating expenses set forth in subsection (4) of this section is prima facie evidence to establish the authenticity of the documents. (6)(a) It is the policy of this state: (A) To encourage the settlement of cases brought under this section; and (B) For courts to enforce the terms of settlements described in paragraph (b) of this subsection to the fullest extent possible, except when to do so would violate the law or would clearly contravene public policy. (b) In a proceeding under this section, the court may enforce the terms set forth in a stipulated judgment of parentage signed by the parties, a judgment of parentage resulting from a settlement on the record or a judgment of parentage incorporating a settlement agreement: (A) As contract terms using contract remedies; (B) By imposing any remedy available to enforce a judgment, including but not limited to contempt; or (C) By any combination of the provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph. (c) A party may seek to enforce an agreement and obtain remedies described in paragraph (b) of this subsection by filing a motion, serving notice on the other party in the manner provided by ORCP 7 and, if a remedy under paragraph (b)(B) of this subsection is sought, complying with the statutory requirements for that remedy. All claims for relief arising out of the same acts or omissions must be joined in the same proceeding. (d) Nothing in paragraph (b) or (c) of this subsection limits a partys ability, in a separate proceeding, to file a motion to set aside, alter or modify a judgment under ORS 109.165 or to seek enforcement of an ancillary agreement to the judgment.

(3) If the child is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under ORS 419B.100, an adoptive parent and a birth relative may enter into a written agreement, approved by the court, to permit continuing contact between the birth relatives and the child or adoptive parents. A birth relative that enters into an agreement under this subsection must have established emotional ties creating an ongoing personal relationship, as defined in ORS 109.119, with the child.

(4) If the child is 14 years of age or older, an agreement made under this section may not be entered into without the consent of the child. (5) As used in this section, birth relative includes a birth parent, grandparent, sibling and other member of the childs birth family. (6) The court may show approval of an agreement made under this section by incorporating the agreement by reference and indicating the courts approval of the agreement in the adoption judgment. (7) Failure to comply with the terms of an agreement made under this section is not grounds for setting aside an adoption judgment or revocation of a written consent to an adoption. (8)(a) An agreement made under this section may be enforced by a civil action.

(1) Any person may petition the circuit court for leave to adopt another person and, if desired, for a change of the other persons name. Except as provided in ORS 419B.529 or 419B.656, a separate petition must be filed for each person for whom leave to adopt is sought. (2) One petitioner, the child, one parent or the person, who is not an adoption agency, consenting to the adoption as required under ORS 109.301 (1) must be a resident of this state. As used in this subsection, resident means a person who has resided in this state continuously for a period of six months prior to the date of the petition. (3) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, when the petition is for the adoption of a minor child, the adoption is governed by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, ORS 109.701 to 109.834. (4)(a) Notwithstanding ORS 109.741 and 109.744 and except as provided in ORS 419B.627, a court of this state has jurisdiction over the adoption of a minor child if, immediately prior to the filing of a petition for adoption: (A) The minor child resided in this state for at least six consecutive months including periods of temporary absence; (B) One parent or another person, who is not an adoption agency, consenting to the adoption as required under ORS 109.301 (1) or 109.302 resided in this state for at least six consecutive months including periods of temporary absence; (C) The prospective adoptive parent resided in this state for at least six consecutive months including periods of temporary absence and substantial evidence is available in this state concerning the present or future care of the minor child; (D) It appears that no court of another state would have jurisdiction under circumstances substantially in accordance with subparagraphs (A) to (C) of this paragraph; or (E) A court of another state has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the grounds that this state is a more appropriate forum to hear a petition for adoption of the minor child and it is in the best interests of the minor child that a court of this state assume jurisdiction. (b) As used in paragraph (a) of this subsection, periods of temporary absence means periods of absence of not more than a total of 30 days in the prior six consecutive months. (5) In a petition to adopt a minor child, venue lies in the Oregon county with which the child has the most significant connection or in the Oregon county in which the licensed adoption agency is located. (6) A petition for adoption of a minor child must comply with the requirements, and be served in the manner, described in ORS 109.285. (7)(a) In a proceeding for the adoption of a minor child, a current home study must be approved by either the Department of Human Services or an Oregon licensed adoption agency for the purpose of demonstrating that the petitioner meets the minimum standards for adoptive homes as set forth in the departments administrative rules. (b) Except when the court finds that there is reason to know that the child is an Indian child, the department, upon request by the petitioner, may waive the home study requirement in an adoption proceeding in which one of the childs biological parents or adoptive parents retains parental rights, or when a relative who qualifies under the departments administrative rules for a waiver of the home study requirement is the prospective adoptive parent. (c) The department shall, subject to ORS 109.270, adopt rules to implement the provisions of this subsection. (8)(a)(A) Within 90 days after service upon the Director of Human Services as required under ORS 109.285, the Department of Human Services shall investigate and file for the consideration of the judge before whom the petition for adoption is pending a placement report containing information regarding the status of the child and evidence concerning the suitability of the proposed adoption. The department may designate an Oregon licensed adoption agency to investigate and report to the court. If the department designates an Oregon licensed adoption agency to investigate and report to the court, the department shall make the designation and provide all necessary information and materials to the Oregon licensed adoption agency no later than 30 days after the service on the director and upon receipt of all required documentation and fees. (B) Except when the court finds that there is reason to know that the child is an Indian child, the department: (i) May waive the placement report requirement under this subsection; and (ii) Shall waive the placement report requirement in an adoption proceeding in which one of the childs biological parents or adoptive parents retains parental rights. (b) Upon receipt of a written request by the petitioner or the petitioners attorney, the department shall furnish to the petitioner or the petitioners attorney copies of any information that the department has filed with the court. (c) Information gathered by the department or by an Oregon licensed adoption agency during the preparation of the placement report may include information concerning the childs social, medical and genetic history and the birth parents history as may be required by ORS 109.301, 109.302 or 109.342.

Nothing in this subsection or subsection (3) of this section requires the department to make a determination of law regarding the documentation provided by the petitioner. (2)(a) Upon receiving an ICWA compliance report, the court shall order the matter to proceed if the court finds that the petitioner satisfied the inquiry requirements under ORS 419B.636 (2) and, if applicable, the notice requirements under ORS 419B.639 (2). (b)(A) If the court finds, subject to the procedures under ORS 419B.636 (4), that there is reason to know that the child is an Indian child, the courts order under this subsection must include a finding regarding whether the proposed adoptive placement complies with the preferences under ORS 419B.654 (2). If the court finds that the proposed adoptive placement does not comply with the preferences or that the documentation provided by the petitioner is insufficient for the court to make a finding, the court shall direct the petitioner to amend the petition to cure the deficiency or file a motion under ORS 419B.654 (3) for authority to make the placement contrary to the placement preferences under ORS 419B.654 (2). (B) If the court finds that the petitioner failed to satisfy the inquiry or, if applicable, the notice requirements under ORS 419B.636 (2) and 419B.639 (2), or if the documentation supplied by the petitioner is insufficient for the court to make those findings, the court shall direct the petitioner to cure the inquiry or notice deficiency and file an amended petition. (c) The court shall order the petitioner to appear and show cause why the court should not dismiss the petition if the court directs the petitioner to file an amended petition or a motion under paragraph (b) of this subsection and the petitioner fails to do so within a reasonable amount of time. (3)(a) The department shall, by rule, provide a nonexhaustive description of the documentation that petitioners or moving parties in proceedings under ORS",

(10)(a) Upon receiving the petitioners declaration of compliance under subsection (4)(c) of this section, the court shall review the petitioners statements and documentation and order that the adoption may proceed if the court finds that the petitioner satisfied the inquiry requirements under ORS 419B.636 (2) and, if applicable, the notice requirements under ORS 419B.639 (2). (b) If the court finds that the petitioner failed to satisfy the inquiry or, if applicable, notice requirements under ORS 419B.636 (2) and 419B.639 (2), or if the documentation is insufficient for the court to make those findings, the court shall direct the petitioner to cure the inquiry or notice deficiency and file an amended declaration of compliance. The court shall order the petitioner to appear and show cause why the court should not deny the motion and order to show cause if the petitioner fails to file the amended declaration of compliance within a reasonable amount of time. (11)(a) If a spouse fails to file a written answer as required in subsection (7) of this section or fails to appear for a hearing related to the motion and order to show cause or the petition as directed by court order under this section, the court, without further notice to the spouse and in the spouses absence, may take any action that is authorized by law, including but not limited to entering a judgment of nonparentage. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, the court may not enter a judgment of nonparentage unless the court finds that the petitioner complied with the inquiry requirements under ORS 419B.636 (2). (12) If the child is an Indian child: (a) The court may not enter a judgment of nonparentage with the consent of the spouse unless: (A) The consent clearly sets out the conditions to the consent, if any; (B) Prior to the execution of the consent, the court explains to the spouse, on the record in detail and in the language of the spouse, the spouses right to legal counsel, the terms and consequences of the consent and that the spouse may withdraw the consent at any time prior to the entry of a judgment of adoption or readoption under ORS 109.350; (C) The spouse executes the consent in person before the court not less than 10 days following the date of the Indian childs birth; and (D) After the spouse executes the consent, the court certifies that the court provided the explanation in the manner required under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph and that the spouse fully understood the explanation. (b) Notwithstanding subsection (9) or (11) of this section, the court may not enter a judgment of nonparentage without the consent of the spouse unless: (A) The court has offered to order mediation through the Department of Human Services, or, if there is mutual party agreement to private mediation and to the party assumption of costs, through other mediation services, between the petitioner, spouse, Indian childs tribe and, if applicable, the proposed adoptive placement; (B) If requested by the tribe, an agreement is in place that requires the petitioner or, if applicable, the proposed adoptive placement to maintain connection between the Indian child and the Indian childs tribe; and (C) The court finds that: (i) The petitioner complied with the notice requirements as required under ORS 419B.639 (2); (ii) Despite petitioners active efforts, evidence, including the testimony of one or more qualified expert witnesses under ORS 419B.642, establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the continued custody of the Indian child by the spouse is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the Indian child and that the petitioners active efforts under ORS 419B.645 to reunite the Indian family did not eliminate the necessity for termination of the spouses parental rights based on serious emotional or physical damage to the Indian child; and (iii) That the adoptive placement complies with the placement preferences under ORS 419B.654 (2) or, if not, a finding upon the petitioners motion under ORS 419B.654 (3) that good cause exists for placement contrary to the placement preferences in ORS 419B.654 (2). (c) The evidence under paragraph (b)(C)(ii) of this subsection must show a causal relationship between the particular conditions in the Indian childs home and the likelihood that the spouses continued custody will result in serious emotional or physical damage to the Indian child who is the subject of the adoption proceeding. Evidence that shows the existence of community or family poverty, isolation, single parenthood, custodian age, crowded or inadequate housing, substance abuse or nonconforming social behavior does not, by itself, establish a causal relationship as required by this paragraph. (13) There shall be sufficient proof to enable the court to grant the relief sought without notice to the spouse if: (a) The affidavit of the mother of the child, of the spouse or of another person with knowledge of the facts filed in the proceeding states or the court finds from other competent evidence: (A) That the mother of the child was not cohabiting with the mothers spouse at the time of conception of the child and that the spouse is not the parent of the child; (B) That the spouse has not been judicially determined to be the parent of the child; (C) That the child has not resided with the spouse; and (D) That the spouse has not contributed or tried to contribute to the support of the child; and (b) The court finds by clear and convincing evidence, after due diligence on the part of the petitioner, that the child is not an Indian child. (14) Notwithstanding ORS 109.070 (1)(a), service of a summons and a motion and order to show cause on the spouse under subsection (3) of this section is not required and the spouses consent, authorization or waiver is not required in adoption proceedings concerning the child unless the child is an Indian child or the spouse has met the requirements of subsection (3)(b)(A), (B) or (C) of this section. (15) A spouse who was not cohabiting with the mother at the time of the childs conception has the primary responsibility to protect the spouses rights. (16) Nothing in this section shall be used to set aside an act of a permanent nature, including but not limited to adoption, unless the parent establishes, within one year or, if the child is an Indian child, four years after the entry of the order or general judgment, as defined in ORS 18.005, fraud on the part of the petitioner with respect to the matters specified in subsection (13)(a) of this section. (17) If the child is an Indian child, the childs tribe or Indian custodian may intervene at any time as a matter of right.",

      "text": "Adoption-related counseling for birth parent. (1) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, a birth parent consenting to an adoption shall receive notice of the birth parents right to payment for three adoption-related counseling sessions prior to surrender or relinquishment of the child for adoption and three sessions of adoption-related counseling after surrender or relinquishment of the child for adoption. (2) Notice of the right to adoption-related counseling shall be in writing and shall be provided to the consenting birth parent by either the attorney for the birth parent, the agency representative taking the birth parents consent or the attorney for the prospective adoptive parent. Before entry of a judgment of adoption, the agency or attorney providing the written notice shall submit verification to the court that the notice was given to the consenting birth parent. (3) The prospective adoptive parent shall pay all uninsured costs of the adoption-related counseling required by this section, provided the counseling is received within one year of the date of surrender or relinquishment of the child for adoption. (4) Adoption-related counseling under this section, unless otherwise agreed to by the prospective adoptive parent and the consenting birth parent, shall be provided by: (a) A regulated social worker as defined in ORS 675.510 who is employed by an Oregon licensed adoption agency other than the regulated social worker assigned to the prospective adoptive parent; (b) A regulated social worker, counselor or therapist who is working under the supervision of a clinical social worker licensed under ORS 675.530 or a licensed professional counselor and who is knowledgeable about birth parent, adoption and grief and loss issues; or (c) A clinical social worker licensed under ORS 675.530, counselor or therapist who: (A) Has a graduate degree in social work, counseling or psychology; and (B) Is knowledgeable about birth parent, adoption and grief and loss issues. (5) The requirements of this section do not apply to: (a) An adoption in which a birth parent relinquishes parental rights to the Department of Human Services; (b) An adoption in which one parent retains parental rights; (c) An adoption in which the child is born in a foreign country and adopted under the laws of that country or readopted in Oregon; (d) An adoption in which the child is born in a foreign country and subsequently adopted in Oregon and in which the identity or whereabouts of the childs birth parents are unknown; or (e) An adoption of an adult. (6) Failure to provide the notice required by this section or failure to pay the uninsured costs of adoption-related counseling required by this section is not grounds for setting aside an adoption judgment or for revocation of a written consent to an adoption or a certificate of irrevocability.

(b) Prior to the execution of a waiver under this subsection, the court must explain to the former parent or prior Indian custodian, on the record in detail and in the language of the former parent or prior Indian custodian: (A) The former parents right to legal counsel, if applicable; (B) The terms and consequences of the waiver; and (C) How the waiver may be revoked. (c) After execution of the waiver, the court shall certify that it provided the explanation as required under paragraph (b) of this subsection and that the former parent or prior Indian custodian fully understood the explanation. (5) At any time prior to the entry of a judgment of adoption or readoption of the Indian child, the former parent or prior Indian custodian may revoke a waiver executed by the former parent or prior Indian custodian by filing a written revocation with the court or by making a statement of revocation on the record in a proceeding for the adoption of the Indian child.

      "text": "Policy and purpose. It is the policy of this state that adoption is based upon the legal termination of parental rights and responsibilities of birth parents and the creation of the legal relationship of parents and child between an adoptee and the adoptive parents. These legal and social premises underlying adoption must be maintained. The state recognizes that some persons who were adopted as children have a strong desire to obtain identifying information about their birth parents, putative father or genetic siblings while other such adoptees have no such desire. The state further recognizes that some birth parents have a strong desire to obtain identifying information about their biological children who were adopted, while other birth parents have no such desire. The state fully recognizes the right to privacy and confidentiality of birth parents whose children were adopted, the adoptees and the adoptive parents. The purpose of ORS 109.425 to 109.507 and 432.250 is to: (1) Set up a voluntary adoption registry where birth parents, putative fathers, adoptees and genetic siblings of adoptees may register their willingness to the release of identifying information to each other; (2) Provide for the disclosure of identifying information to birth parents and their progeny through a person employed or approved by a licensed adoption agency or the Department of Human Services, if the relevant persons for such disclosure are registered; (3) Provide for the transmission of nonidentifying health and genetic and social histories of adoptees, birth parents, putative fathers, genetic siblings of adoptees and other specified persons; and (4) Provide for disclosure of specific identifying information to Indian tribes or governmental agencies when needed to establish the adoptees eligibility for tribal membership or for benefits or to a person responsible for settling an estate that refers to the adoptee.

(2) Relatives of minor children are frequently asked, with minimal notice, to provide housing and health care, and to make educational decisions, for minor children who are left in their care. (3) Relative caregivers frequently face barriers to obtaining necessary and appropriate medical treatment and educational services for minor children left in their care. (4) These barriers pose a significant challenge to relative caregivers in dealing with health care providers and schools, and pose a substantial threat to the health, safety and welfare of minor children in this state. (5) It is necessary to provide legal authority for relative caregivers to access necessary and appropriate medical treatment and educational services for minor children who are left in the relative caregivers care and who are without legal parents or guardians who can otherwise provide for them.

(1) A relative caregiver acting pursuant to an affidavit under ORS 109.580 may consent to medical treatment and educational services for a minor child that a minor child cannot otherwise legally consent to if, after reasonable efforts have been made to obtain the consent of the legal parent or guardian to the treatment or services, the consent of the legal parent or guardian cannot be obtained. (2) A relative caregiver providing consent under this section is liable to the health care provider or school for payment for any medical treatment or educational services provided to a minor child pursuant to the consent. (3) The consent of a relative caregiver under this section shall be superseded by any contravening decision of the legal parent or guardian, provided the decision does not threaten the life, health or safety of the minor child. (4) If the minor child stops living with the relative caregiver, the relative caregiver shall immediately notify any health care provider or school that has been given an affidavit under ORS 109.580. The affidavit is invalid immediately upon receipt by the health care provider or school of the notice under this subsection.

(b) Upon receipt of a valid affidavit as described in ORS 109.580, a health care provider or school may, but is not required to, request documentation of a persons claimed status as a relative caregiver and of attempts made to obtain the consent of the legal parent or guardian. (7) A relative caregiver acting in good faith with reasonable grounds to provide consent for medical treatment or educational services pursuant to an affidavit under ORS 109.580 is not subject to criminal or civil liability that might otherwise be incurred or imposed for giving consent to the medical treatment or educational services.

(2) For purposes of this section, minor means an unemancipated and unmarried person who is living apart from the persons parent, parents or legal guardian, and who is either: (a) Sixteen or 17 years of age; (b) Under 16 years of age and the parent of a child or children who are living in the physical custody of the person; or (c) Under 16 years of age, pregnant and expecting the birth of a child who will be living in the physical custody of the person. (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a minor may contract for the necessities of a residential dwelling unit and for utility services to that unit. Such a contract is binding upon the minor and cannot be voided or disaffirmed by the minor based upon the minors age or status as a minor. (4) The consent of the parent or legal guardian of such minor shall not be necessary to contract for a residential dwelling unit or utility services to that unit. The parent or legal guardian of such minor shall not be liable under a contract by that minor for a residential dwelling unit or for utility services to that unit unless the parent or guardian is a party to the minors contract, or enters another contract, for the purpose of acting as guarantor of the minors debt.",
