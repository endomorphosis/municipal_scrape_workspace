However, the determination of value or valuation shall be made by the director. (4) The director shall be furnished with not fewer than two accurate copies of the plan or sketch and details for the purpose of ascertaining compliance with applicable fire prevention and protection statutes and regulations. The plan examiner shall indicate on the plan or sketch and in writing approval or disapproval and conditions for approval of the construction or alteration. One copy of the plan or sketch shall be retained by the director and one copy shall be returned to the applicant. No building or structure referred to in subsection (2) of this section shall be erected or constructed without approval by the director if the building or structure requires approval by the State Fire Marshal. After such approval or issuance of the required permit, construction or alteration must comply with the plan or sketch in all respects unless modified by subsequent permit or order of the director. (5) The approval of a plan or sketch may not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any statute or regulation or the applicable ordinances and regulations of any governmental subdivision of the state. The approval of a plan or sketch may not be construed as an approval for noncompliance with fire marshal regulations. Any condition upon approval or disapproval is an order subject to appeal as other orders are appealable. (6) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsections (2) and (4) of this section, the State Fire Marshal may, by rule, require an additional copy of a plan or sketch for local government use and may specify that plans or sketches submitted for review be drawn clearly and to scale.",

The complaint or appeal shall set forth the specific grounds of the complaint or appeal and no other ground shall be considered thereafter. The complaint or appeal shall be accompanied by a fee of $40 payable to the State Fire Marshal, and the State Fire Marshal may refer the complaint or appeal to the regional appeal advisory board established for that region by notifying the chairperson of that board and sending a copy of the notice to the complainant or appellant. The board shall fix a time for hearing and notify the complainant or appellant of the time and place thereof, which shall be within 10 days after such referral by the State Fire Marshal. If the State Fire Marshal does not refer the matter to a regional appeal advisory board, the State Fire Marshal shall fix a time and place, not less than five and not more than 10 days thereafter, when and where the complaint or appeal will be heard by the State Fire Marshal. Within 10 days after receiving a recommendation from the regional appeal advisory board, or if no referral was made to such board, within 10 days after the hearing before the State Fire Marshal, the State Fire Marshal may affirm, modify, revoke or vacate the order complained of or appealed from. Unless the order is modified, revoked or vacated by the State Fire Marshal, it shall remain in force and be complied with by the owner, lessee, agent or occupant, and within the time fixed in the order or fixed by the State Fire Marshal. If the State Fire Marshal vacates or revokes the order complained of or appealed from, or modified it in any particular other than extending time for compliance, the fee paid with the complaint or appeal shall be refunded. Otherwise, it shall be credited to appropriate state funds, and the State Fire Marshal shall so notify the State Treasurer. (2) If the complainant or appellant under subsection (1) of this section is aggrieved by the final order of the State Fire Marshal, and if such order necessitates the expenditure of money or involves statutory interpretation, the complainant or appellant may, within 10 days thereafter, appeal to the circuit court of the county in which the property is situated, notifying the State Fire Marshal of the appeal within 10 days thereafter, which notice shall be in writing and delivered personally or by registered letter to the marshal, or left at the principal office of the Department of the State Fire Marshal at the state capital. The party so appealing shall, within two days after filing the appeal, file with the circuit court in which appeal is made a bond in an amount to be fixed by the court or judge, but in no case less than $100, with two sufficient sureties possessing the qualification of bail on arrest, the bond to be approved by the court and conditioned to pay all the costs on the appeal in case the appellant fails to sustain it or it is dismissed for any cause. In the case of an appeal involving an order under ORS 479.170, the circuit court shall hear and determine the appeal within 10 days after the date of filing the same. (3) The State Fire Marshal shall make or have made a certified summary of the proceedings at the hearing before the regional appeal advisory board or before the State Fire Marshal, and together with all the evidentiary matter filed with the department or presented to the regional appeal advisory board, transmit them to the circuit court at least three days prior to the date fixed by the court for hearing when it shall be tried de novo.",

The following apply to an appeal under this section: (1) An appeal under this section is subject to ORS chapter 183. (2) An appeal under this section must be made first to the Chief Electrical Inspector of the Department of Consumer and Business Services. The decision of the Chief Electrical Inspector may be appealed to the Electrical and Elevator Board. The decision of the Electrical and Elevator Board may be appealed to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services only if codes in addition to the electrical code are at issue. (3) If the Electrical and Elevator Board determines that a decision by the Chief Electrical Inspector is a major code interpretation, then the inspector shall distribute the decision in writing to all public and private electrical inspection authorities in the state. The decision shall be distributed within 60 days after the boards determination, and there shall be no charge for the distribution of the decision. As used in this subsection, a major code interpretation means a code interpretation decision that affects or may affect more than one job site or more than one inspection jurisdiction. (4) If an appeal is made under this section, an inspection authority shall extend the electrical plan review deadline by the number of days it takes for a final decision to be issued for the appeal. (5) Unless the department determines that the electrical product or electrical installation presents an immediate fire or life safety hazard, a person may operate an electrical product or electrical installation that is the subject of an appeal under this section until the appeal process is complete. If the department determines that an immediate fire or life safety hazard exists and the product or installation may not be operated during appeal, the department shall provide the person with a written report detailing the problems found by the department. If a determination is made under this subsection that products described in ORS 479.540 (11) may not be operated during appeal, that determination may be appealed immediately under the procedure established in subsection (2) of this section without first completing any appeal procedure established by a city or county.",
