This section contains statements of purpose or intent that are applicable to portions of the vehicle code as described in the following: (1) The provisions of the vehicle code and other statutory provisions described in this subsection are an exercise of the police powers of this state, and the purpose, object and intent of the sections is to provide a comprehensive system for the regulation of all motor and other vehicles in this state. This subsection is applicable to the following: (a) Those provisions of the vehicle code relating to the administration of the Department of Transportation. (b) Those provisions of the vehicle code relating to the registration and titling of vehicles. (c) Those provisions of the vehicle code relating to the regulation of the businesses of vehicle dealers, dismantlers, vehicle transporters, driver training schools and instructors and the towing and recovery of vehicles. (d) Those provisions relating to the transfer and alteration of vehicles. (2) It is the policy of this state to promote and encourage the fullest possible use of its highway system by authorizing the making and execution of motor vehicle reciprocal or proportional registration agreements, arrangements and declarations with other states, provinces, territories and countries with respect to vehicles registered in this and such other states, provinces, territories and countries, thus contributing to the economic and social development and growth of this state. (3) The provisions described in this subsection shall be applicable and uniform throughout this state and in all political subdivisions and municipalities therein and on the ocean shore which has been or may hereafter be declared a state recreation area. This subsection applies to provisions of the vehicle code relating to abandoned vehicles, vehicle equipment, regulation of vehicle size, weight and load, the manner of operation of vehicles and use of roads by persons, animals and vehicles. (4) The provisions of the vehicle code applicable to drivers of vehicles upon the highways shall apply to the drivers of all vehicles owned or operated by the United States, this state or any county, city, district or any other political subdivision of this state, subject to such specific exceptions as are set forth in the vehicle code. (5) Except as provided otherwise by federal law, the provisions of the vehicle code shall be applicable and uniform on federal lands within this state. (6) Except as provided otherwise by federal law, traffic rules and regulations which are promulgated by a federal authority having jurisdiction over federal lands within this state and which vary from the provisions of the vehicle code shall be the law of the local authority within whose boundaries the federal land is located, and enforceable as such, if: (a) Local authorities are authorized to vary in the same manner under the provisions of the vehicle code; and (b) Prior approval for the variance has been obtained by the federal authority from the governing body of the local authority within whose boundaries the federal land is located. (7) The vehicle code shall govern the construction of and punishment for any vehicle code offense committed after June 27, 1975, the construction and application of any defense to a prosecution for such an offense and any administrative proceedings authorized or affected by the vehicle code. (8) When all or part of a vehicle code statute is amended or repealed, the statute or part thereof so amended or repealed remains in force for the purpose of authorizing the accusation, prosecution, conviction and punishment of a person who violated the statute or part thereof before the effective date of the amending or repealing Act. (9) The provisions of the vehicle code described in this subsection relating to the operation of vehicles refer exclusively to operation of vehicles upon highways and the ocean shore which has been or may hereafter be declared to be a state recreation area, except where the vehicle code specifically provides otherwise. This subsection applies to the provisions of the vehicle code relating to abandoned vehicles, vehicle equipment, regulation of vehicle size, weight and load, the manner of operation of vehicles and use of roads by persons, animals and vehicles. (10) All reciprocity and proportional registration agreements, arrangements and declarations relating to vehicles, in force and effect on August 22, 1969, shall continue in force and effect until specifically amended or revoked as provided by law or by such arrangements or agreements. (11) It is hereby declared to be the policy of this state: (a) To provide maximum safety for all persons who travel or otherwise use the public highways of this state; (b) To deny the privilege of operating motor vehicles on the public highways to persons who by their conduct and record have demonstrated their indifference for the safety and welfare of others and their disrespect for the laws of the state, the orders of its courts and the statutorily required acts of its administrative agencies; and (c) To discourage repetition of criminal acts by individuals against the peace and dignity of the state and its political subdivisions and to impose increased and added deprivation of the privilege to operate motor vehicles upon habitual offenders who have been convicted repeatedly of violations of traffic laws. (12) If any of the provisions under ORS 818.200 relating to variance permits are found to contravene section 127 of title 23, United States Code, it shall not serve to render inoperative any remaining of such provisions that may be held not to conflict with that federal law.",

This section describes circumstances where special provisions are made concerning the authority of cities, counties or other political subdivisions in relation to some portion of the vehicle code. This section is not the only section of the vehicle code that applies to such authority and shall not be interpreted to affect the vehicle code except as specifically provided in this section. The following limits are partial or complete as described: (1) No county, municipal or other local body with authority to adopt and administer local police regulations under the Constitution and laws of this state shall enact or enforce any rule or regulation in conflict with the provisions of the vehicle code described in this subsection except as specifically authorized in the vehicle code. This subsection applies to the provisions of the vehicle code relating to abandoned vehicles, vehicle equipment, regulation of vehicle size, weight and load, the manner of operation of vehicles and use of roads by persons, animals and vehicles. (2) Except as provided in ORS 822.230 and this subsection, no city, county or other political subdivisions shall regulate or require or issue any registration, licenses, permits or surety bonds or charge any fee for the regulatory or surety registration of any person required to obtain a certificate from the Department of Transportation under ORS 822.205. This subsection does not: (a) Limit any authority of a city or county to license and collect a general and nondiscriminatory license fee levied upon all businesses or to levy a tax based upon business conducted by any person within the city or county. (b) Limit the authority of any city or county to impose any requirements or conditions as part of any contract to perform towing or recovering services for the city or county. (c) Limit the authority of any city or county to impose requirements and conditions that govern the towing of a vehicle by a towing business under ORS 98.812 so long as those requirements and conditions are consistent with the provisions of ORS 822.230. (3) No city, county or other political subdivision of this state, nor any state agency, may adopt a regulation or ordinance that imposes a special fee for the use of public lands or waters by snowmobiles or Class I all-terrain vehicles, or for the use of any access thereto that is owned by or under the jurisdiction of either the United States, this state or any such city, county or other political subdivision. The registration fees provided by ORS 821.320 are in lieu of any personal property or excise tax imposed on snowmobiles by this state or any political subdivision. No city, county or other municipality, and no state agency shall impose any other registration or license fee on any snowmobile in this state. This subsection does not prohibit any city, county or other political subdivision, or any state agency from regulating the operation of snowmobiles or Class I all-terrain vehicles on public lands, waters and other properties under its jurisdiction and on streets or highways within its boundaries by adopting regulations or ordinances of its governing body if such regulations are not inconsistent with ORS 821.150 to 821.292. (4) The provisions of ORS 819.110 to 819.215 relating to towing of vehicles that are abandoned establish minimum requirements subject to the following: (a) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this subsection, a county or incorporated city may supersede such provisions by ordinance or charter provision. (b) Any road authority described under ORS 810.010 may adopt rules or procedures that do not conflict with such provisions to provide for additional protection for the owner or person with an interest in a vehicle subject to such provisions or that more quickly accomplish the procedures established under such provisions. (5) Any incorporated city may by ordinance require that the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident file with a designated city department a copy of any report required to be filed under ORS 811.725. All such reports shall be for the confidential use of the city department but subject to the same requirements for release of such reports as provided for the release of such reports by the department under ORS 802.220 and 802.240. (6) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, in accordance with the provisions of ORS 801.041, the governing body of a county may establish by ordinance registration fees for vehicles registered at a residence or business address within the county. (7) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, in accordance with the provisions of ORS 801.042, the governing body of a district may establish by ordinance registration fees for vehicles registered at a residence or business address within the district.",

The following apply to the authority granted to counties by ORS 801.040 to establish registration fees for vehicles: (1) An ordinance establishing registration fees under this section must be enacted by the county imposing the registration fee and filed with the Department of Transportation. Notwithstanding ORS 203.055 or any provision of a county charter, the governing body of a county with a population of 350,000 or more may enact an ordinance establishing registration fees. The governing body of a county with a population of less than 350,000 may enact an ordinance establishing registration fees after submitting the ordinance to the electors of the county for their approval. The governing body of the county imposing the registration fee shall enter into an intergovernmental agreement under ORS 190.010 with the department by which the department shall collect the registration fees, pay them over to the county and, if necessary, allow the credit or credits described in ORS 803.445 (5). The intergovernmental agreement must state the date on which the department shall begin collecting registration fees for the county. (2) The authority granted by this section allows the establishment of registration fees in addition to those described in ORS 803.420 and 803.422. There is no authority under this section to affect registration periods, qualifications, cards, plates, requirements or any other provision relating to vehicle registration under the vehicle code. (3) Except as otherwise provided for in this subsection, when registration fees are imposed under this section, they must be imposed on all vehicle classes. Registration fees as provided under this section may not be imposed on the following: (a) Snowmobiles and Class I all-terrain vehicles. (b) Fixed load vehicles. (c) Vehicles registered under ORS 805.100 to disabled veterans. (d) Vehicles registered as antique vehicles under ORS 805.010. (e) Vehicles registered as vehicles of special interest under ORS 805.020. (f) Government-owned or operated vehicles registered under ORS 805.040 or 805.045. (g) School buses or school activity vehicles registered under ORS 805.050. (h) Law enforcement undercover vehicles registered under ORS 805.060. (i) Vehicles registered on a proportional basis for interstate operation. (j) Vehicles with a registration weight of 26,001 pounds or more described in ORS 803.420 (14)(a) or (b). (k) Vehicles registered as farm vehicles under the provisions of ORS 805.300. (L) Travel trailers, campers and motor homes. (m) Vehicles registered to an employment address as provided in ORS 802.250 when the eligible public employee or household members residence address is not within the county of the employment address. The department may adopt rules it considers necessary for the administration of this paragraph. (n) Vehicles registered under ORS 805.110 to former prisoners of war. (4) Any registration fee imposed by a county must be a fixed amount not to exceed, with respect to any vehicle class, the sum of the registration fee established under ORS 803.420 (6)(a) and the fee applicable to the registered vehicle under ORS 803.422. For vehicles on which a flat fee is imposed under ORS 803.420, the fee must be a whole dollar amount. (5) Moneys from registration fees established under this section must be paid to the county establishing the registration fees as provided in ORS 802.110. (6) Except as provided in ORS 801.044, or unless a different distribution is agreed upon by the county and the cities within the jurisdiction of the county, the county ordinance shall provide for payment of at least 40 percent of the moneys from registration fees established under this section to cities within the county. (7) The moneys for the cities and the county shall be used for any purpose for which moneys from registration fees may be used, including the payment of debt service and costs related to bonds or other obligations issued for such purposes. (8) Two or more counties may act jointly to impose a registration fee under this section. The ordinance of each county acting jointly with another under this subsection must provide for the distribution of moneys collected through a joint registration fee.

The intergovernmental agreement must state the date on which the department shall begin collecting registration fees for the district. (6) The authority granted by this section allows the establishment of registration fees in addition to those described in ORS 803.420 and 803.422. There is no authority under this section to affect registration periods, qualifications, cards, plates, requirements or any other provision relating to vehicle registration under the vehicle code.

Intersection means the area of a roadway created when two or more roadways join together at any angle, as described in one of the following: (1) If the roadways have curbs, the intersection is the area embraced within the prolongation or connection of the lateral curb lines. (2) If the roadways do not have curbs, the intersection is the area embraced within the prolongation or connection of the lateral boundary lines of the roadways. (3) The junction of an alley with a roadway does not constitute an intersection. (4) Where a highway includes two roadways 30 feet or more apart, then every crossing of each roadway of the divided highway by an intersection highway is a separate intersection. In the event the intersection highway also includes two roadways 30 feet or more apart, then every crossing of two roadways of such highways is a separate intersection.",
