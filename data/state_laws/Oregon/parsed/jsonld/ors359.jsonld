(b) The work of fine art, or the consignors portion of the proceeds from the sale of the work, is not subject to the claims of a creditor of the consignee.

(d) The consignee may not be held liable for the loss of or damage to the work of fine art if the consignor fails to remove the work within a period of 30 days following the date agreed upon for removal of the work in the written contract between the consignor and the consignee or, if no written agreement regarding a removal date exists, 30 days after notice to remove the work of fine art is sent by registered mail or by certified mail with return receipt to the consignor at the consignors last-known address.

(3) The consignees failure to furnish the information specified under subsection (2) of this section entitles the consignor to obtain an injunction ordering the disclosure of the information and money damages in an amount equal to three times the consignors portion of the retail value of the work.",
