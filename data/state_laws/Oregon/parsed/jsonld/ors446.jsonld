The department shall design the rules adopted for purposes of this subsection to protect the interests of all parties to the transfer of interest. (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section: (a) In the case of a transfer of an interest by operation of law, the personal representative, receiver, trustee, sheriff, landlord or other representative or successor in interest of the person whose interest is transferred shall file the acknowledgment described in subsection (1) of this section. The representative or successor shall also provide the transferee with information satisfactory to the department concerning all facts entitling the representative or successor to transfer the interest. If there is no person to transfer the interest, the person to whom interest is awarded or otherwise transferred is responsible for providing the information concerning the persons entitlement to the interest. (b) In the case of a transfer at death of the interest of the owner or security interest holder of the manufactured structure, if the estate is not being probated and ownership is not being transferred under the provisions of ORS 114.547, an interest in the manufactured structure may be assigned through the use of an affidavit. The affidavit must be on a form prescribed by the department and signed by all of the known heirs of the person whose interest is being transferred, and shall state the name of the person to whom the ownership interest has been passed. If any heir has not arrived at the age of majority or is otherwise incapacitated, the parent or guardian of the heir shall sign the affidavit. (c) In the case of a transfer at death of the interest of the owner or security interest holder where transfer occurs under ORS 114.547, the affiant, as defined in ORS 114.505, is the person required to assign interest. (d) A security interest holder, without the consent of the owner, may assign interest of the holder in a manufactured structure to a person other than the owner without affecting the interest of the owner or the validity or priority of the interest. A person who is not given notice of the assignment is protected in dealing with the security interest holder as the holder of the interest until the assignee files notice of the interest with the department as provided in ORS 446.571. This paragraph does not exempt an assignment of interest from the acknowledgment requirement under subsection (1) of this section. (e) If an interest in a manufactured structure is transferred pursuant to an application under ORS 446.591 (5), the recital by the escrow company that no written objections were received constitutes both a release, termination, assignment or transfer of interest and an acknowledgment by the person whose interest is released, terminated, assigned or transferred. (3) Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to a transfer of a security interest where the security interest holder is a financial institution, a financial holding company or a bank holding company, as those terms are defined in ORS 706.008, a licensee under ORS chapter 725, or any subsidiary or affiliate of any of the foregoing and the transfer of the interest of the security interest holder: (a) Results from the merger, conversion, reorganization, consolidation or acquisition of the security interest holder; or (b) Is to an entity that is a member of the same affiliated group as the security holder.

      "text": "Recording manufactured structures in county deed records; effect on security interest; recording as establishment of real property interest. (1) The owner of a manufactured structure that qualifies under this subsection may apply to the county assessor to have the structure recorded in the deed records of the county. The application must be on a form approved by the Department of Consumer and Business Services. The application must include a description of the location of the real property on which the manufactured structure is or will be sited. If the structure is being sold by a manufactured structure dealer, the dealer may file the application on behalf of the owner within the time described in ORS 446.736 (7). A manufactured structure qualifies for recording in the deed records if the owner of the structure: (a) Also owns the land on which the manufactured structure is located; (b) Is the holder of a recorded leasehold estate of 20 years or more if the lease specifically permits the manufactured structure owner to record the structure under this section; or (c) Is a member of a manufactured dwelling park nonprofit cooperative formed under ORS 62.800 to 62.815 that owns the land on which the manufactured structure is located. (2) If the assessor, as agent for the department, determines that the manufactured structure qualifies for recording in the deed records of the county, the assessor shall cause the structure to be recorded in the deed records. The deed records must contain any unreleased security interest in the manufactured structure. If the department has issued an ownership document for the manufactured structure, the owner must submit the ownership document to the assessor with the application described in subsection (1) of this section. Upon recording the manufactured structure in the deed records, the assessor shall send the ownership document to the department for cancellation. The department shall cancel the ownership document and send confirmation of the cancellation to the assessor and the owner. (3) The recording of a security interest in the deed records of the county under this section satisfies the requirements for filing a financing statement for a fixture to real property under ORS 79.0502. The recording of a manufactured structure in the deed records of the county is independent of the assessment and taxation of the structure as real property under ORS 308.875. The recording of a manufactured structure in the deed records of the county makes the structure subject to the same provisions of law applicable to any other building, housing or structure on the land. However, the manufactured structure may not be sold separately from the land or leasehold estate unless the owner complies with subsection (4) of this section. (4) The owner of a manufactured structure that is recorded in the deed records of the county may apply to have the structure removed from the deed records and an ownership document issued for the structure. Unless the manufactured structure is subject to ORS 446.631, the owner must apply to the county assessor, as agent for the department, for an ownership document as provided in ORS 446.571. Upon approval of the application, the assessor shall terminate the recording of the manufactured structure in the deed records. (5) If a manufactured structure described in subsection (1)(b) or (c) of this section is recorded in the deed records, the owner of the structure has a real property interest in the manufactured structure for purposes of: (a) Recordation of documents pursuant to ORS 93.600 to 93.802, 93.804, 93.806 and 93.808; (b) Deed forms pursuant to ORS 93.850 to 93.870; (c) Mortgages, trust deeds and other liens pursuant to ORS chapters 86, 87 and 88; and (d) Real property tax collection pursuant to ORS chapters 311 and 312. The structure owner is considered the owner of the real property for purposes of assessing the structure under ORS 308.875.

(b) Fails to comply with the requirements for notices or reports of the transfer of interest in manufactured structures. (c) Moves a manufactured structure or causes a manufactured structure to be moved without complying with the requirements for variance permits under ORS 818.200 and trip permits under ORS 446.631. (d) Knowingly provides false information on an application for a dealer license, supplemental license or corrected dealer license. (e) Deals in a manufactured structure that both before and after the sale is assessed as real property under ORS 308.875 or is recorded in the deed records of a county. This paragraph does not apply if an ownership document is issued for the manufactured structure prior to sale. (f) Employs a person in an administrative or managerial capacity while the person is disqualified under subsection (5) of this section. (g) Fails, in conducting activities of a mortgage loan originator, to comply with the provisions of: (A) The Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq., and Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. part 1026, as in effect on October 1, 2013; (B) The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, 12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq., and Regulation X, 12 C.F.R. part 1024, as in effect on January 1, 2013; (C) The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. 1691 et seq., and Regulation B, 12 C.F.R. part 1002, as in effect on January 1, 2013; or (D) The S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act, 12 U.S.C. 5101 et seq., and Regulation H, 12 C.F.R. part 1008, as in effect on January 1, 2013. (h) Fails to certify to the director in a form and manner the director specifies by rule that the dealer has independently verified that every individual the dealer hired or intends to hire as a mortgage loan originator meets the requirements set forth in ORS 86A.200 to 86A.239 and ORS 86A.186. (i) Employs a device, scheme or artifice to defraud or engage in an act, practice or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit. (j) Knowingly makes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits from a statement a material fact that would make the statement not misleading in light of the circumstances under which the dealer makes the statement. (k) Makes or files or causes to be made or filed with the director a statement, report or document that the dealer knows is false in a material respect or matter. (2) The director shall cancel a manufactured structure dealer license immediately upon receipt of legal notice that a bond described under ORS 446.726 or under ORS 86A.227 is canceled. (3) Upon suspension, revocation or cancellation of a manufactured structure dealer license under this section, the director shall demand the return of the license. (4) The director shall cancel a dealer license or supplemental license immediately upon receipt of notice that zoning approval for a place of business has been revoked. (5) If the director finds that a violation of subsection (1)(d), (i), (j) or (k) of this section has occurred, the director may issue an order under ORS chapter 183 disqualifying, for up to seven years after the date that the disqualification becomes effective: (a) The dealer whose license is revoked from: (A) Obtaining a license as a manufactured structure dealer; or (B) Working in an administrative or managerial capacity for a manufactured structure dealer. (b) Any other person whose acts or omissions were material to the events that were the basis for the violation from working in an administrative or managerial capacity for a manufactured structure dealer. (6) If a person who is subject to disqualification or who is disqualified under subsection (5) of this section elects to pay restitution to a customer whom the director finds suffered harm as a result of the violation of subsection (1)(d), (i), (j) or (k) of this section, the director may choose not to issue an order of disqualification to the person or may rescind a previously issued order of disqualification. (7) A person who applies for licensing as a manufactured structure dealer following a period of disqualification under subsection (5) of this section must meet the requirements for issuance of an initial manufactured structure dealer license.
