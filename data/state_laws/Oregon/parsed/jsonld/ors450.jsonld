(1) The State Treasurer may purchase from a district at private sale sewerage system bonds bearing interest at a rate agreed upon by the State Treasurer and the district. The bonds shall qualify for investment by the state only if the sewer connection charges and revenues of the sewerage system of the issuing district, after the payment of operation and maintenance expenses, are pledged wholly to the payment of the principal of and interest upon the bonds, and the issuing district shall covenant to levy ad valorem taxes upon all of the taxable property within its boundaries to meet deficiencies in the charges and revenues pledged, and only if the combined indebtedness for all public purposes, other than state or federal, within the boundaries of the district, including the proposed sewerage system indebtedness, but excluding obligations issued for other utilities that are self-supporting or self-liquidating or are approximately so, does not exceed 25 percent of the total real market value of all taxable property within the district as reflected in the last roll certified under ORS 311.105. The limitation shall apply only to districts that finance the costs of their sewerage systems under ORS 450.250 to 450.300. The limitation shall include the ratios of indebtedness to the total valuation, determined in like manner, of other subdivisions that overlap the district to an extent of more than 50 percent of the total value of the district. Indebtedness within the 25 percent limitation may be incurred by a district if approved by the electors of the district at an election called and held for that purpose. Notwithstanding that revenues may have been pledged to the payment of the principal of and the interest upon a particular issue of general obligation bonds owned by the state, the same revenues, with the approval of the State Treasurer, may be pledged to the payment of the principal of and the interest on additional issues of bonds purchased by the state from the district. The additional issues shall be on a parity with previous issues as to the pledge of charges and revenues. In order to complete the financing of a sewerage system, after bonds payable as to principal and interest from revenues and ad valorem taxation have been issued, the State Treasurer may purchase issues of general obligation sewerage system bonds of districts, payable only from ad valorem property taxes, provided such issues, together with other obligations of the district, do not exceed the debt limits specified in this section. (2) All bonds heretofore issued under authority of ORS 450.250 to 450.300 and sold to the state, and the proceedings under which they were issued, are approved, validated, ratified, and confirmed, and the bonds are the valid and legally binding general obligations of the issuing district.",

The limitation shall apply only to districts that finance the costs of their sewerage systems under ORS 450.250 to 450.300. The limitation shall include the ratios of indebtedness to the total valuation, determined in like manner, of other subdivisions that overlap the district to an extent of more than 50 percent of the total value of the district. Indebtedness within the 25 percent limitation may be incurred by a district if approved by the electors of the district at an election called and held for that purpose. Notwithstanding that revenues may have been pledged to the payment of the principal of and the interest upon a particular issue of general obligation bonds owned by the state, the same revenues, with the approval of the State Treasurer, may be pledged to the payment of the principal of and the interest on additional issues of bonds purchased by the state from the district. The additional issues shall be on a parity with previous issues as to the pledge of charges and revenues. In order to complete the financing of a sewerage system, after bonds payable as to principal and interest from revenues and ad valorem taxation have been issued, the State Treasurer may purchase issues of general obligation sewerage system bonds of districts, payable only from ad valorem property taxes, provided such issues, together with other obligations of the district, do not exceed the debt limits specified in this section.",

The resolution shall set forth the name and boundaries of the proposed water authority and the number of members to be on the board of directors of the proposed authority.

(2) Upon receipt of the resolution, the county governing body or boundary commission shall determine that provision of potable water to the area within the proposed water authority can best be achieved by creation of a water authority rather than by water districts or cities. In making this determination, the county governing body shall consider the following factors: (a) The ability of the proposed authority to provide water service to the area within the proposed authority; (b) The effect on both long and short-term rates for patrons within the proposed authority; (c) The impact, if any, of the proposed water authority on adjacent special districts and cities; and (d) Consistency of the proposed water authority with the adopted comprehensive plan of the county within the boundaries of the proposed water authority. (3) After the county governing body or boundary commission makes the determination under subsection (2) of this section, the county governing body shall by order provide for a public hearing on the proposal. The order shall set forth the date, time and place of the hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be given in the manner provided by ORS 198.800 except that the notice shall state that the governing bodies of the cities or water districts have filed a resolution with the county governing body declaring their intention to initiate formation. The hearing and election on the proposal, and election of board members, shall be conducted as provided by ORS 198.800 to 198.825.",

Uncollected taxes theretofore levied by such districts shall become the property of the water authority or the sanitary authority and be delivered to it by the county treasurer upon collection.

The resolution shall set forth the name and boundaries of the proposed sanitary authority.

In making this determination, the county governing body shall consider the following factors: (a) The ability of the proposed authority to provide sewage disposal or drainage services to the area within the proposed authority; (b) The effect on both long and short-term rates for patrons within the proposed authority; (c) The impact, if any, of the proposed authority on adjacent special districts and cities; and (d) Consistency of the proposed authority with the adopted comprehensive plan of the county within the boundaries of the proposed water authority.

Parcels of land which may be served practicably by lateral sewers or drains connected with treatment plants or trunk sewers or drains and are not adequately served by existing plants, sewers or drains, as the case may be, are considered to be directly benefited by the plants, sewers or drains of the sanitary authority. If all or any portion of the cost of construction is to be specially assessed against individual property, the engineer shall include in the plans and specifications, a description of the location and assessed value of each lot, tract or parcel of land, or portion thereof, to be specially benefited by the improvement, with the names of the record owners thereof and an estimate of the unit cost of the improvement to the specially benefited property.",

The county treasurer shall pay out moneys of the authority only upon written order of the board, signed by the chairperson of the board and countersigned by the manager of the authority. However, where the board has authorized the manager to approve and order the payment of claims in the amount of $500 or less, the treasurer shall pay out moneys of the authority on such orders of the manager. (2) The order shall specify the name of the person to whom the money is to be paid, the fund from which it is to be paid and shall state generally the purpose for which payment is to be made. (3) A copy of the order shall be filed in the records of the board. The county treasurer shall keep the order as a voucher and shall keep account of the receipts and disbursements of money for the sanitary authority. (4) The county treasurer shall keep separate accounts and funds, where necessary, to segregate the various operations and construction projects of the authority. (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1) to (4) of this section, any funds of the authority other than taxes may be deposited, at the discretion of the board, in one or more banks or savings and loan associations to be designated by the board. Funds deposited in a bank or savings and loan association shall be withdrawn or paid out only upon proper order and warrant or check signed by the chairperson and countersigned by the manager.
