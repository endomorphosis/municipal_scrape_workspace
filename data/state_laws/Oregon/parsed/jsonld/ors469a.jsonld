(2) Banked renewable energy certificate means a bundled or unbundled renewable energy certificate that is not used by an electric utility or electricity service supplier to comply with a renewable portfolio standard in a calendar year, and that is carried forward for the purpose of compliance with a renewable portfolio standard in a subsequent year. (3) BPA electricity means electricity provided by the Bonneville Power Administration, including electricity generated by the Federal Columbia River Power System hydroelectric projects and electricity acquired by the Bonneville Power Administration by contract. (4) Bundled renewable energy certificate means a renewable energy certificate for qualifying electricity that is acquired: (a) By an electric utility or electricity service supplier by a trade, purchase or other transfer of electricity that includes the renewable energy certificate that was issued for the electricity; (b) By an electric utility by generation of the electricity for which the renewable energy certificate was issued; or (c) By an electricity service supplier by retirement by an electric company where the renewable energy certificate satisfied paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection prior to such retirement and was retired on behalf of the electricity service supplier on behalf of a retail electricity consumer that pays transition adjustments to the electric company. (5) Compliance year means the calendar year for which the electric utility or electricity service supplier seeks to establish compliance with the renewable portfolio standard applicable to the electric utility or electricity service supplier in the compliance report submitted under ORS 469A.170. (6) Consumer-owned utility means a municipal electric utility, a peoples utility district organized under ORS chapter 261 that sells electricity or an electric cooperative organized under ORS chapter 62. (7) Distribution utility has the meaning given that term in ORS 757.600. (8) Electric company has the meaning given that term in ORS 757.600. (9) Electric utility has the meaning given that term in ORS 757.600. (10) Electricity service supplier has the meaning given that term in ORS 757.600.

(1) Except as provided in ORS 469A.180 (5), all prudently incurred costs associated with complying with ORS 469A.005 to 469A.210 are recoverable in the rates of an electric company, including interconnection costs, costs associated with using physical or financial assets to integrate, firm or shape renewable energy sources on a firm annual basis to meet retail electricity needs, above-market costs and other costs associated with transmission and delivery of qualifying electricity to retail electricity consumers. (2)(a) The Public Utility Commission shall establish an automatic adjustment clause as defined in ORS 757.210 or another method that allows timely recovery of costs prudently incurred by an electric company to construct or otherwise acquire facilities that generate electricity from renewable energy sources, costs related to associated electricity transmission and costs related to associated energy storage. (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon the request of any interested person the commission shall conduct a proceeding to establish the terms of the automatic adjustment clause or other method for timely recovery of costs. The commission shall provide parties to the proceeding with the procedural rights described in ORS 756.500 to 756.610, including but not limited to the opportunity to develop an evidentiary record, conduct discovery, introduce evidence, conduct cross-examination and submit written briefs and oral argument. The commission shall issue a written order with findings on the evidentiary record developed in the proceeding. (3)(a) An electric company must file with the commission for approval of a proposed rate change to recover costs under the terms of an automatic adjustment clause or other method for timely recovery of costs established under subsection (2) of this section. As part of an electric companys request for approval under this subsection, the electric company may specify the date or the dates on which the electric company will begin to include in the electric companys rates, in full or in part, the costs recoverable under subsection (2) of this section. The commission may accept or reject the date or dates specified by the electric company. (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon the request of any interested person the commission shall conduct a proceeding to determine whether to approve a proposed change in rates under the automatic adjustment clause or other method for timely recovery of costs.

(b) The department shall use the method of measuring greenhouse gas emissions set forth in ORS 468A.280 to verify the projected greenhouse gas emissions reductions forecasted in a clean energy plan of an electric company or the information provided by an electricity service supplier under subsection (3) of this section. (c) The department shall report the departments findings under paragraph (b) of this subsection to the Public Utility Commission and the electric company seeking acknowledgement of a clean energy plan by the commission. (2) The Public Utility Commission shall acknowledge the clean energy plan if the commission finds the plan to be in the public interest and consistent with the clean energy targets set forth in ORS 469A.410.

(3) In addition to the emissions report required under subsection (4) of this section, an electricity service supplier shall report to the commission: (a) An estimate of annual greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity sold by the electricity service supplier to retail electricity consumers for the current year and following three years; (b) Annual goals set by the electricity service supplier for actions described under paragraph (c)(A) of this subsection, including a projected reduction of annual greenhouse gas emissions associated with the electricity sold to retail electricity consumers by the electricity service supplier; (c) Other information necessary, as determined by the commission, to demonstrate the electricity service suppliers anticipated ability to meet the clean energy targets set forth in ORS 469A.410, including: (A) Actions to make continual progress toward meeting the clean energy targets that are consistent with providing affordable, reliable, and clean electricity service; and (B) Anticipated actions to facilitate rapid reductions of greenhouse gas emissions at reasonable costs to retail electricity consumers served by the electricity service supplier; and (d) The commission shall review the information supplied by an electricity service supplier under this subsection for the purposes of determining whether the electricity service supplier is making continual and reasonable progress toward compliance with the clean energy targets set forth in ORS 469A.410. (4)(a) A retail electricity provider shall report annual greenhouse gas emissions associated with the electricity sold to retail electricity consumers by the retail electricity provider to the Department of Environmental Quality in the manner set forth under ORS 468A.280, or rules adopted pursuant thereto.
