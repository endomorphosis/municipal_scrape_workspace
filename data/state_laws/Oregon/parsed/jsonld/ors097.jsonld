The head of all contracts and certificates of ownership or deeds referring to plots in this area must contain the phrase nonendowed care in at least 10-point black type. (13) A nonendowed care cemetery is a cemetery that does not deposit in an endowment care fund the minimum amounts specified in subsection (2) of this section.

(3) All such trust funds shall be deposited by the provider with a financial institution in the State of Oregon carrying deposit insurance, within 15 days after receipt thereof. A trust fund shall be held in a separate account in the name of the provider followed by the words funeral plan trust account, in trust for the person for whom such prearranged funeral plan is made, or in a common trust account in the name of the provider in trust for each person for whom such prearranged funeral plan is made, until a trust fund is released under any of the following conditions: (a) Upon presentation of proof of the death of the person for whom a prearranged funeral plan is made, the financial institution shall release the principal and accrued income allocable to that persons account to the provider. (b) Upon presentation of the written request of the purchaser of a revocable trust, the financial institution shall release the principal and accrued income allocable to the purchasers account as directed in such request. (c) Upon presentation of proof of the death, dissolution, insolvency or merger with another of the provider of a revocable trust, the financial institution shall release the principal and accrued income allocable to each purchasers account to that purchaser. (d) Upon presentation of proof of the death, dissolution, insolvency or merger with another of the provider of an irrevocable trust, the financial institution shall continue to hold such trust fund subject to the funeral plan trust, and upon appointment of a successor provider by the purchaser, the purchasers legal representative, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services or a court of competent jurisdiction, the financial institution shall release such trust fund to the successor provider only as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection. (4) If trust funds are held in a common trust account under subsection (3) of this section, the provider shall maintain records showing the purchaser and beneficiary of each individual trust fund in the account and the allocation to each individual trust fund of interest earned by the account. The records concerning allocation of interest must be updated at least annually. (5) The provider may appoint a successor depository. The original depository shall only release the trust funds to the successor depository as described in subsections (1) to (4) of this section. (6) The financial institution is not responsible for the fulfillment of any prearranged funeral plan, excepting only such financial institution shall release a trust fund as provided in this section. (7) The director may appoint a successor provider upon a determination that the original provider has ceased to provide the kinds of services and things which the original provider agreed to provide, that the purchaser or the purchasers legal representative cannot be readily identified or contacted and that the appointment of a successor provider is appropriate in order to protect the interests of the trust beneficiaries. Financial institutions holding deposits of such trust funds shall change their records to reflect such appointment of a successor provider upon receipt of written notice of the appointment from the director. Where the director proposes to take such action under this subsection, the provider being replaced shall be accorded notice and an opportunity for hearing as provided in ORS chapter 183.

(1) A depository may not make any distributions from preconstruction sales contract trust deposits except as provided in this section. (2)(a) The construction or development of undeveloped interment spaces shall be commenced on the phase of construction or development, or the section or sections of spaces in which sales are made within five years of the date of the first sale. The certified provider who sold the preconstruction sales contract shall give written notice including a description of the project to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services no later than 30 days after the first sale. (b) Once commenced, construction or development shall be pursued diligently to completion. The first phase of construction must be completed within seven years of the first sale. However, any delay caused by strike, shortage of materials, civil disorder, natural disaster or any similar occurrence beyond the control of the certified provider extends the time of completion by the length of a delay. (c) If construction or development is not commenced or completed within the times specified, any contract purchaser may surrender and cancel the contract and upon cancellation shall be entitled to a refund of the actual amounts paid toward the purchase price, together with interest accrued on the amount deposited to the trust. (3) Except as otherwise authorized by this section, every certified provider selling undeveloped spaces shall provide facilities for temporary interment for purchasers or beneficiaries of contracts who die prior to completion of the space. Such temporary facilities shall be constructed of permanent materials, and, insofar as practical, be landscaped and groomed to the extent customary in that community. The heirs, assigns or personal representative of a purchaser or beneficiary shall not be required to accept temporary underground interment space where undeveloped space contracted for was an aboveground entombment or inurnment space. In the event that temporary facilities as described in this subsection are not made available upon the death of a purchaser or beneficiary, the heirs, assigns or personal representative is entitled to a refund of the entire sales price paid plus undistributed interest attributable to such amount while in trust. (4) If the certified provider who sold the preconstruction sales contract delivers a completed space acceptable to the heirs, assigns or personal representative of a purchaser or beneficiary, other than a temporary facility, in lieu of the undeveloped space purchased, the certified provider shall provide the depository with a delivery certificate and all sums deposited under the preconstruction sales contract and income allocable to that contract shall be paid to the certified provider. (5) During the construction or development of interment spaces, upon receiving the sworn certification of the certified provider who sold the preconstruction sales contract and the contractor, the depository shall disburse from the trust fund the amount equivalent to the cost of performed labor or delivered materials as certified, not to exceed the amounts deposited and income allocable to those contracts. A person who executes and delivers a completion certificate with actual knowledge of a falsity contained therein shall be considered in violation of ORS 97.923 to 97.949 and 692.180. (6) Upon completion of the phase of construction or development, section or sections of the project as certified to the depository by the certified provider and the contractor, the trust requirements shall terminate and all funds held in the preconstruction sales contract trust fund attributable to the completed phase, section or sections shall be paid to the certified provider who sold the preconstruction sales contract. (7) Upon the payment to a certified provider of preconstruction sales contract trust funds under subsection (4) or (6) of this section, the undistributed income of the trust shall be paid to: (a) The certified provider who sold the contract if the contract is a guaranteed contract; or (b) The contract purchaser, or the purchasers estate, if the contract is a nonguaranteed contract. (8) If the preconstruction sales contract purchaser defaults in making payments under an installment preconstruction sales contract, and default continues for at least 30 days after the purchaser has received written notice of default, the certified provider who sold the contract may cancel the contract and withdraw from the trust fund the entire balance of the defaulting purchasers account as liquidated damages. Upon certification of the default, the depository shall deliver the balance to the certified provider. The depository may rely on the certification and affidavits made to it under the provisions of ORS 97.923 to 97.949, 97.992, 97.994 and 692.180 and shall not be liable to any person for such reliance.

(1) An anatomical gift may be made to the following persons named in the document of gift: (a) A hospital, accredited medical school, dental school, college, university, organ procurement organization or other appropriate person, for research or education; (b) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, an individual designated by the person making the anatomical gift if the individual is the recipient of the body part; or (c) An eye bank or tissue bank. (2) If an anatomical gift to an individual under subsection (1)(b) of this section cannot be transplanted into the individual, the body part passes in accordance with subsection (7) of this section in the absence of an express, contrary indication by the person making the anatomical gift. (3) If an anatomical gift of one or more specific body parts or of all body parts is made in a document of gift that does not name a person described in subsection (1) of this section but identifies the purpose for which an anatomical gift may be used, the following rules apply: (a) If the body part is an eye and the gift is for the purpose of transplantation or therapy, the gift passes to the appropriate eye bank. (b) If the body part is tissue and the gift is for the purpose of transplantation or therapy, the gift passes to the appropriate tissue bank. (c) If the body part is an organ and the gift is for the purpose of transplantation or therapy, the gift passes to the appropriate organ procurement organization as custodian of the organ. (d) If the body part is an organ, an eye or tissue and the gift is for the purpose of research or education, the gift passes to the appropriate procurement organization. (4) For the purposes of subsection (3) of this section, if there is more than one purpose of an anatomical gift set forth in the document of gift but the purposes are not set forth in any priority, the gift must be used for transplantation or therapy, if suitable. If the gift cannot be used for transplantation or therapy, the gift may be used for research or education. (5) If an anatomical gift of one or more specific body parts is made in a document of gift that does not name a person described in subsection (1) of this section and does not identify the purpose of the gift, the gift may be used only for transplantation or therapy, and the gift passes in accordance with subsection (7) of this section. (6) If a document of gift specifies only a general intent to make an anatomical gift by words such as donor, organ donor or body donor or by a symbol or statement of similar import, the gift may be used only for transplantation or therapy, and the gift passes in accordance with subsection (7) of this section. (7) For purposes of subsections (2), (5) and (6) of this section, the following rules apply: (a) If the body part is an eye, the gift passes to the appropriate eye bank. (b) If the body part is tissue, the gift passes to the appropriate tissue bank. (c) If the body part is an organ, the gift passes to the appropriate organ procurement organization as custodian of the organ. (8) An anatomical gift of an organ for transplantation or therapy, other than an anatomical gift under subsection (1)(b) of this section, passes to the organ procurement organization as custodian of the organ. (9) If an anatomical gift does not pass pursuant to subsections (1) to (8) of this section or the decedents body or body part is not used for transplantation, therapy, research or education, custody of the body or body part passes to the person under obligation to dispose of the body or body part. (10) A person may not accept an anatomical gift if the person knows that the gift was not effectively made under ORS 97.957 or 97.967 or if the person knows that the decedent made a refusal under ORS 97.961 that was not revoked. For purposes of this subsection, if a person knows that an anatomical gift was made on a document of gift, the person is deemed to know of any amendment or revocation of the gift or any refusal to make an anatomical gift on the same document of gift.

(1) When a hospital refers an individual at or near death to a procurement organization, the organization shall make a reasonable search of the records of the Department of Transportation and any donor registry that it knows exists for the geographical area in which the individual resides to ascertain whether the individual has made an anatomical gift. (2) A procurement organization must be allowed reasonable access to information in the records of the Department of Transportation to ascertain whether an individual at or near death is a donor. (3) When a hospital refers an individual at or near death to a procurement organization, the organization may conduct any reasonable examination necessary to ensure the medical suitability of a body part that is or could be the subject of an anatomical gift for transplantation, therapy, research or education from a donor or a prospective donor. During the examination period, measures necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the body part may not be withdrawn unless the hospital or procurement organization knows that the individual expressed a contrary intent. (4)(a) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, at any time after a donors death, the person to whom a body part passes under ORS 97.969 may conduct any reasonable examination necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the body or body part for its intended purpose. (b) A transplant hospital may not deny a recipient from receiving an anatomical gift exclusively on the basis that the recipient is a registry identification cardholder as defined in ORS 475C.777. (5) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, an examination under subsection (3) or (4)(a) of this section may include an examination of all medical and dental records of the donor or prospective donor. (6) Upon the death of a minor who was a donor or had signed a refusal, unless a procurement organization knows the minor is emancipated, the procurement organization shall conduct a reasonable search for the parents of the minor and provide the parents with an opportunity to revoke or amend the anatomical gift or revoke the refusal. (7) Upon referral by a hospital under subsection (1) of this section, a procurement organization shall make a reasonable search for any person listed in ORS 97.965 having priority to make an anatomical gift on behalf of a prospective donor. If a procurement organization receives information that an anatomical gift to any other person was made, amended or revoked, it shall promptly advise the other person of all relevant information. (8) Subject to ORS 97.969 (9) and 97.980, the rights of the person to whom a body part passes under ORS 97.969 are superior to the rights of all others with respect to the body part. The person may accept or reject an anatomical gift in whole or in part. Subject to the terms of the document of gift and ORS 97.951 to 97.982, a person who accepts an anatomical gift of an entire body may allow embalming, burial, cremation or reduction and use of remains in a funeral service. If the gift is of a body part, the person to whom the body part passes under ORS 97.969, upon the death of the donor and before embalming, burial, cremation or reduction, shall cause the body part to be removed without unnecessary mutilation. (9) Neither the physician who attends the decedent at death nor the physician who determines the time of the decedents death may participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a body part from the decedent. (10) A physician or technician may remove from the body of a donor a donated body part that the physician or technician is qualified to remove.

(3) A person who has any information requested by a medical examiner pursuant to subsection (2) of this section shall provide that information as expeditiously as possible to allow the medical examiner to conduct the medicolegal investigation within a period compatible with the preservation of body parts for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research or education.

(5) If an anatomical gift of a body part from the decedent under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner has been or might be made, but the medical examiner initially believes that the recovery of the body part could interfere with the post-mortem investigation into the decedents cause or manner of death, the medical examiner shall consult with the procurement organization, or physician or technician designated by the procurement organization, about the proposed recovery. The procurement organization shall provide the medical examiner with all of the information that the procurement organization possesses that could relate to the decedents cause or manner of death. (6)(a) The medical examiner and the procurement organization may enter into an agreement establishing protocols and procedures governing their relationship when: (A) An anatomical gift of a body part from a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner has been or might be made; and (B) The medical examiner believes that the recovery of the body part could interfere with the post-mortem investigation into the decedents cause or manner of death or the documentation or preservation of evidence. (b) A decision regarding the recovery of the body part from the decedent shall be made in accordance with the agreement. (c) The medical examiner and the procurement organization shall evaluate the effectiveness of the agreement at regular intervals but not less frequently than every two years. (7)(a) In the absence of an agreement establishing protocols and procedures governing the relationship between the medical examiner and the procurement organization when an anatomical gift of an eye or tissue from a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner has been or might be made, and following the consultation under subsection (5) of this section, the medical examiner may delay the recovery of the eye or tissue until after the collection of evidence or the post-mortem examination, in order to preserve and collect evidence, to maintain a proper chain of custody and to allow an accurate determination of the decedents cause or manner of death. (b) When a determination to delay the recovery of an eye or tissue is made, every effort possible shall be made by the medical examiner to complete the collection of evidence or the post-mortem examination in a timely manner compatible with the preservation of the eye or tissue for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research or education. (c) The collection of evidence or the post-mortem examination shall occur during the normal business hours of the medical examiner and, when possible and practicable, at times other than the normal business hours of the medical examiner.

(9) If the medical examiner allows recovery of a body part, the procurement organization shall cooperate with the medical examiner in any documentation of injuries and the preservation and collection of evidence prior to and during the recovery of the body part and, upon request of the medical examiner, shall cause the physician or technician who removes the body part to provide the medical examiner with a record describing the condition of the body part, a photograph and any other information and observations that would assist in the post-mortem examination.
