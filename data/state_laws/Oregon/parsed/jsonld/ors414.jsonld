      "text": "Legislative intent; findings. (1) It is the intention of the Legislative Assembly to achieve the goals of universal access to an adequate level of high quality health care at an affordable cost. (2) The Legislative Assembly finds: (a) A significant level of public and private funds is expended each year for the provision of health care to Oregonians; (b) The state has a strong interest in assisting Oregon businesses and individuals to obtain reasonably available insurance or other coverage of the costs of necessary basic health care services; (c) The lack of basic health care coverage is detrimental not only to the health of individuals lacking coverage, but also to the public welfare and the states need to encourage employment growth and economic development, and the lack results in substantial expenditures for emergency and remedial health care for all purchasers of health care including the state; and (d) The use of integrated and coordinated health care systems has significant potential to reduce the growth of health care costs incurred by the people of this state. (3) The Legislative Assembly finds that achieving its goals of improving health, increasing the quality, reliability, availability and continuity of care and reducing the cost of care requires an integrated and coordinated health care system in which: (a) Medical assistance recipients and individuals who are dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid participate. (b) Health care services, other than Medicaid-funded long term care services, are delivered through coordinated care contracts that use alternative payment methodologies to focus on prevention, improving health equity and reducing health disparities, utilizing patient centered primary care homes, behavioral health homes, evidence-based practices and health information technology to improve health and health care. (c) High quality information is collected and used to measure health outcomes, health care quality and costs and clinical health information. (d) Communities and regions are accountable for improving the health of their communities and regions, reducing avoidable health gaps among different cultural groups and managing health care resources. (e) Care and services emphasize preventive services and services supporting individuals to live independently at home or in their community. (f) Services are person centered, and provide choice, independence and dignity reflected in individual plans and provide assistance in accessing care and services. (g) Interactions between the Oregon Health Authority and coordinated care organizations are done in a transparent and public manner. (h) Moneys provided by the federal government for medical education are allocated to the institutions that provide the education. (4) The Legislative Assembly further finds that there is an extreme need for a skilled, diverse workforce to meet the rapidly growing demand for community-based health care. To meet that need, this state must: (a) Build on existing training programs; and (b) Provide an opportunity for frontline care providers to have a voice in their workplace in order to effectively advocate for quality care. (5) As used in subsection (3) of this section: (a) Community means the groups within the geographic area served by a coordinated care organization and includes groups that identify themselves by age, ethnicity, race, economic status, or other defining characteristic that may impact delivery of health care services to the group, as well as the governing body of each county located wholly or partially within the coordinated care organizations service area. (b) Region means the geographical boundaries of the area served by a coordinated care organization as well as the governing body of each county that has jurisdiction over all or part of the coordinated care organizations service area.

(2) A licensed practitioner may prescribe such drugs under this chapter as the practitioner in the exercise of professional judgment considers appropriate for the diagnosis or treatment of the patient in the practitioners care and within the scope of practice. Prescriptions shall be dispensed in the generic form pursuant to ORS 689.515 and pursuant to rules of the Oregon Health Authority unless the practitioner prescribes otherwise and an exception is granted by the authority. (3) Except as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section, the authority shall place no limit on the type of legend drug that may be prescribed by a practitioner, but the authority shall pay only for drugs in the generic form unless an exception has been granted by the authority. (4) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, an exception must be applied for and granted before the authority is required to pay for minor tranquilizers and amphetamines and amphetamine derivatives, as defined by rule of the authority. (5)(a) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (4) of this section and except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the authority is authorized to: (A) Withhold payment for a legend drug when federal financial participation is not available; and (B) Require prior authorization of payment for drugs that the authority has determined should be limited to those conditions generally recognized as appropriate by the medical profession. (b) The authority may not require prior authorization for: (A) Therapeutic classes of nonsedating antihistamines and nasal inhalers, as defined by rule by the authority, when prescribed by an allergist for treatment of any of the following conditions, as described by the Health Evidence Review Commission on the funded portion of its prioritized list of services: (i) Asthma; (ii) Sinusitis; (iii) Rhinitis; or (iv) Allergies. (B) Any mental health drug prescribed for a medical assistance recipient if: (i) The claims history available to the authority shows that the recipient has been in a course of treatment with the drug during the preceding 365-day period; or (ii) The prescriber specifies on the prescription dispense as written or includes the notation D.A.W. or words of similar meaning. (6) The authority shall pay a rural health clinic for a legend drug prescribed and dispensed under this chapter by a licensed practitioner at the rural health clinic for an urgent medical condition if: (a) There is not a pharmacy within 15 miles of the clinic; (b) The prescription is dispensed for a patient outside of the normal business hours of any pharmacy within 15 miles of the clinic; or (c) No pharmacy within 15 miles of the clinic dispenses legend drugs under this chapter. (7) Notwithstanding ORS 414.334, the authority may conduct prospective drug utilization review in accordance with ORS 414.351 to 414.414. (8) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, the authority may pay a pharmacy for a particular brand name drug rather than the generic version of the drug after notifying the pharmacy that the cost of the particular brand name drug, after receiving discounted prices and rebates, is equal to or less than the cost of the generic version of the drug. (9)(a) Within 180 days after the United States patent expires on an immunosuppressant drug used in connection with an organ transplant, the authority shall determine whether the drug is a narrow therapeutic index drug. (b) As used in this subsection, narrow therapeutic index drug means a drug that has a narrow range in blood concentrations between efficacy and toxicity and requires therapeutic drug concentration or pharmacodynamic monitoring.",

As used in ORS 414.351 to 414.414: (1) Compendia means those resources widely accepted by the medical profession in the efficacious use of drugs, including the following sources: (a) The American Hospital Formulary Service drug information. (b) The United States Pharmacopeia drug information. (c) The American Medical Association drug evaluations. (d) Peer-reviewed medical literature. (e) Drug therapy information provided by manufacturers of drug products consistent with the federal Food and Drug Administration requirements. (2) Criteria means the predetermined and explicitly accepted elements based on compendia that are used to measure drug use on an ongoing basis to determine if the use is appropriate, medically necessary and not likely to result in adverse medical outcomes. (3) Drug-disease contraindication means the potential for, or the occurrence of, an undesirable alteration of the therapeutic effect of a given prescription because of the presence, in the patient for whom it is prescribed, of a disease condition or the potential for, or the occurrence of, a clinically significant adverse effect of the drug on the patients disease condition. (4) Drug-drug interaction means the pharmacological or clinical response to the administration of at least two drugs different from that response anticipated from the known effects of the two drugs when given alone, which may manifest clinically as antagonism, synergism or idiosyncrasy. Such interactions have the potential to have an adverse effect on the individual or lead to a clinically significant adverse reaction, or both, that: (a) Is characteristic of one or any of the drugs present; or (b) Leads to interference with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion or therapeutic efficacy of one or any of the drugs. (5) Drug use review means the programs designed to measure and assess on a retrospective and a prospective basis, through an evaluation of claims data, the proper utilization, quantity, appropriateness as therapy and medical necessity of prescribed medication in the medical assistance program. (6) Intervention means an action taken by the Oregon Health Authority with a: (a) Prescriber or pharmacist to inform about or to influence prescribing or dispensing practices; or (b) Recipient, prescriber or pharmacist to inform about or to influence the utilization of drugs. (7) Overutilization means the use of a drug in quantities or for durations that put the recipient at risk of an adverse medical result. (8) Pharmacist means an individual who is licensed as a pharmacist under ORS chapter 689. (9) Prescriber means any person authorized by law to prescribe drugs. (10) Prospective program means the prospective drug use review program described in ORS 414.369. (11) Retrospective program means the retrospective drug use review program described in ORS 414.371. (12) Standards means the acceptable prescribing and dispensing methods determined by compendia, in accordance with local standards of medical practice for health care providers. (13) Therapeutic appropriateness means drug prescribing based on scientifically based and clinically relevant drug therapy that is consistent with the criteria and standards developed under ORS 414.351 to 414.414. (14) Therapeutic duplication means the prescribing and dispensing of two or more drugs from the same therapeutic class such that the combined daily dose puts the recipient at risk of an adverse medical result or incurs additional program costs without additional therapeutic benefits. (15) Underutilization means that a drug is used by a recipient in insufficient quantity to achieve a desired therapeutic goal. [2011 c.720 1; 2015 c.467 5] Note:",

(1) The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee shall advise the Oregon Health Authority on: (a) Adoption of rules to implement ORS 414.351 to 414.414 in accordance with ORS chapter 183. (b) Implementation of the medical assistance program retrospective and prospective programs as described in ORS 414.351 to 414.414, including the type of software programs to be used by the pharmacist for prospective drug use review and the provisions of the contractual agreement between the state and any entity involved in the retrospective program. (c) Development of and application of the criteria and standards to be used in retrospective and prospective drug use review in a manner that ensures that such criteria and standards are based on compendia, relevant guidelines obtained from professional groups through consensus-driven processes, the experience of practitioners with expertise in drug therapy, data and experience obtained from drug utilization review program operations. The committee shall have an open professional consensus process for establishing and revising criteria and standards. Criteria and standards shall be available to the public. In developing recommendations for criteria and standards, the committee shall establish an explicit ongoing process for soliciting and considering input from interested parties. The committee shall make timely revisions to the criteria and standards based upon this input in addition to revisions based upon scheduled review of the criteria and standards. Further, the drug utilization review standards shall reflect the local practices of prescribers in order to monitor: (A) Therapeutic appropriateness. (B) Overutilization or underutilization. (C) Therapeutic duplication. (D) Drug-disease contraindications. (E) Drug-drug interactions. (F) Incorrect drug dosage or drug treatment duration. (G) Clinical abuse or misuse. (H) Drug allergies. (d) Development, selection and application of and assessment for interventions that are educational and not punitive in nature for medical assistance program prescribers, dispensers and patients. (2) In reviewing retrospective and prospective drug use, the committee may consider only drugs that have received final approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration. (3) The committee shall make recommendations to the authority, subject to approval by the Director of the Oregon Health Authority or the directors designee, for drugs to be included on any preferred drug list adopted by the authority and on the Practitioner-Managed Prescription Drug Plan. The committee shall also recommend all utilization controls, prior authorization requirements or other conditions for the coverage of a drug. (4) In making recommendations under subsection (3) of this section, the committee may use any information the committee deems appropriate. The recommendations must be based upon the following factors in order of priority: (a) Safety and efficacy of the drug. (b) The ability of Oregonians to access effective prescription drugs that are appropriate for their clinical conditions. (c) Substantial differences in the costs of drugs within the same therapeutic class. (5)(a) No later than seven days after the date on which the committee makes a recommendation under subsection (3) of this section, the committee shall publish the recommendation on the website of the authority. (b) As soon as practicable after the committee makes a recommendation, the director shall decide whether to approve, disapprove or modify the recommendation, shall publish the decision on the website and shall notify persons who have requested notification of the decision. (c) Except as provided in subsection (6) of this section, a recommendation approved by the director, in whole or in part, with respect to the inclusion of a drug on a preferred drug list or the Practitioner-Managed Prescription Drug Plan may not become effective less than seven days after the date that the directors decision is published on the website. (6)(a) The director may allow the immediate implementation of a recommendation described in subsection (5)(c) of this section if the director determines that immediate implementation is necessary to protect patient safety or to comply with state or federal requirements. (b) The director shall reconsider any decision to approve, disapprove or modify a recommendation described in subsection (5)(c) of this section upon the request of any interested person filed no later than seven days after the directors decision is published on the website of the authority. The directors determination regarding the request for reconsideration shall be sent to the requester and posted to the website without undue delay. Upon receipt of a request for reconsideration, the director may: (A) Delay the implementation of the recommendation pending the reconsideration process; or (B) Implement the recommendation if the director determines that delay could reasonably result in harm to patient safety or would violate state or federal requirements.

      "text": "Coordinated care organization contracts; terms and amendments; 60 days advance notice; refusal to renew. (1) As used in this section: (a) Benefit period means a period of time, shorter than the five-year contract term, for which specific terms and conditions in a contract between a coordinated care organization and the Oregon Health Authority are in effect. (b) Renew means an agreement by a coordinated care organization to amend the terms or conditions of an existing contract for the next benefit period. (2) A contract entered into between the authority and a coordinated care organization under ORS 414.572 (1): (a) Shall be for a term of five years; (b) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, may not be amended more than once in each 12-month period; and (c) May be terminated by the authority if a coordinated care organization fails to meet outcome and quality measures specified in the contract or is otherwise in breach of the contract. (3) This section does not prohibit the authority from allowing a coordinated care organization a reasonable amount of time in which to cure any failure to meet outcome and quality measures specified in the contract prior to the termination of the contract. (4) A contract entered into between the authority and a coordinated care organization may be amended: (a) More than once in each 12-month period if: (A) The authority and the coordinated care organization mutually agree to amend the contract; or (B) Amendments are necessitated by changes in federal or state law. (b) Once within the first eight months of the effective date of the contract if needed to adjust the global budget of a coordinated care organization, retroactive to the beginning of the calendar year, to take into account changes in the membership of the coordinated care organization or the health status of the coordinated care organizations members. (5) Except as provided in subsection (8) of this section, the authority must give a coordinated care organization at least 60 days advance notice of any amendments the authority proposes to existing contracts between the authority and the coordinated care organization. (6) Except as provided in subsection (4)(b) of this section, an amendment to a contract may apply retroactively only if: (a) The amendment does not result in a claim by the authority for the recovery of amounts paid by the authority to the coordinated care organization prior to the date of the amendment; or (b) The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services notifies the authority, in writing, that the amendment is a condition for approval of the contract by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. (7) If an amendment to a contract under subsection (6)(b) of this section or other circumstances arise that result in a claim by the authority for the recovery of amounts previously paid to a coordinated care organization by the authority, the authority shall ensure that the recovery does not have a material adverse effect on the coordinated care organizations ability to maintain the required minimum amounts of risk-based capital. (8) No later than 134 days prior to the end of a benefit period, the authority shall provide to each coordinated care organization notice of the proposed changes to the terms and conditions of a contract, as will be submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for approval, for the next benefit period. (9) A coordinated care organization must notify the authority of the coordinated care organizations refusal to renew a contract with the authority no later than 14 days after the authority provides the notice described in subsection (8) of this section. Except as provided in subsections (10) and (11) of this section, a refusal to renew terminates the contract at the end of the benefit period. (10) The authority may require a contract to remain in force into the next benefit period and be amended as proposed by the authority until 90 days after the coordinated care organization has, in accordance with criteria prescribed by the authority: (a) Notified each of its members and contracted providers of the termination of the contract; (b) Provided to the authority a plan to transition its members to another coordinated care organization; and (c) Provided to the authority a plan for closing out its coordinated care organization business. (11) The authority may waive compliance with the deadlines in subsections (9) and (10) of this section if the Director of the Oregon Health Authority finds that the waiver of the deadlines is consistent with the effective and efficient administration of the medical assistance program and the protection of medical assistance recipients.

      "text": "Alternative payment methodologies. (1) The Oregon Health Authority shall encourage coordinated care organizations to use alternative payment methodologies that: (a) Reimburse providers on the basis of health outcomes and quality measures instead of the volume of care; (b) Hold organizations and providers responsible for the efficient delivery of quality care; (c) Reward good performance; (d) Limit increases in medical costs; and (e) Use payment structures that create incentives to: (A) Promote prevention; (B) Provide person centered care; and (C) Reward comprehensive care coordination using delivery models such as patient centered primary care homes and behavioral health homes. (2) The authority shall encourage coordinated care organizations to utilize alternative payment methodologies that move from a predominantly fee-for-service system to payment methods that base reimbursement on the quality rather than the quantity of services provided. (3) A coordinated care organization that participates in a national primary care medical home payment model, conducted by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 1315a, that includes performance-based incentive payments for primary care, shall offer similar alternative payment methodologies to all patient centered primary care homes identified in accordance with ORS 413.259 that serve members of the coordinated care organization. (4) The authority shall assist and support coordinated care organizations in identifying cost-cutting measures. (5) If a service provided in a health care facility is not covered by Medicare because the service is related to a health care acquired condition, the cost of the service may not be: (a) Charged by a health care facility or any health services provider employed by or with privileges at the facility, to a coordinated care organization, a patient or a third-party payer; or (b) Reimbursed by a coordinated care organization. (6)(a) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) of this section, until July 1, 2014, a coordinated care organization that contracts with a Type A or Type B hospital or a rural critical access hospital, as described in ORS 442.470, shall reimburse the hospital fully for the cost of covered services based on the cost-to-charge ratio used for each hospital in setting the global payments to the coordinated care organization for the contract period. (b) The authority shall base the global payments to coordinated care organizations that contract with rural hospitals described in this section on the most recent audited Medicare cost report for Oregon hospitals adjusted to reflect the Medicaid mix of services. (c) The authority shall identify any rural hospital that would not be expected to remain financially viable if paid in a manner other than as prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection based upon an evaluation by an actuary retained by the authority. On and after July 1, 2014, the authority may, on a case-by-case basis, require a coordinated care organization to continue to reimburse a rural hospital determined to be at financial risk, in the manner prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection. (d) This subsection does not prohibit a coordinated care organization and a hospital from mutually agreeing to reimbursement other than the reimbursement specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection. (e) Hospitals reimbursed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection are not entitled to any additional reimbursement for services provided. (7) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) of this section, coordinated care organizations must comply with federal requirements for payments to providers of Indian health services, including but not limited to the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 1396j and 42 U.S.C. 1396u-2(a)(2)(C).

The assessment shall be imposed at a rate determined by the Director of the Oregon Health Authority by rule that is the directors best estimate of the rate needed to fund the services and costs identified in ORS 414.869. The rate of assessment shall be imposed on the net revenue of each hospital subject to assessment. The director shall consult with representatives of hospitals before setting the assessment. (2) Each assessment shall be reported on a form prescribed by the Oregon Health Authority and shall contain the information required to be reported by the authority. The assessment form shall be filed with the authority on or before the 45th day following the end of the calendar quarter for which the assessment is being reported. Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the hospital shall pay the assessment at the time the hospital files the assessment report. The payment shall accompany the report. (3)(a) To the extent permitted by federal law, aggregate assessments imposed under this section may not exceed the total of the following amounts received by the hospitals that are reimbursed by Medicare based on diagnostic related groups: (A) 30 percent of payments made to the hospitals on a fee-for-service basis by the authority for inpatient hospital services; (B) 41 percent of payments made to the hospitals on a fee-for-service basis by the authority for outpatient hospital services; and (C) Payments made to the hospitals using a payment methodology established by the authority that advances the goals of the Oregon Integrated and Coordinated Health Care Delivery System described in ORS 414.570 (3). (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, aggregate assessments imposed under this section on or after July 1, 2015, may exceed the total of the amounts described in paragraph (a) of this subsection to the extent necessary to compensate for any reduction of funding in the legislatively adopted budget for hospital services under ORS 414.591, 414.631 and 414.688 to 414.745. (c) The director may impose a lower rate of assessment on type A hospitals and type B hospitals to take into account the hospitals financial position. (4) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, a hospital is not guaranteed that any additional moneys paid to the hospital in the form of payments for services shall equal or exceed the amount of the assessment paid by the hospital. (5)(a) The authority shall develop a schedule for collection of the assessment for the calendar quarter ending September 30, 2021, that will result in the collection occurring between December 15, 2021, and the time all Medicaid cost settlements are finalized for that calendar quarter. (b) The authority shall prescribe by rule criteria for late payment of assessments. [2003 c.736 2; 2007 c.780 1; 2009 c.828 51; 2009 c.867 17; 2013 c.608 2; 2015 c.16 1; 2017 c.538 27,28,29] Note:",
