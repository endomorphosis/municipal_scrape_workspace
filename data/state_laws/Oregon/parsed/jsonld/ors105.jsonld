In the case of a dwelling unit to which ORS chapter 90 applies: (1) A default judgment shall be entered in favor of the plaintiff for possession of the premises and costs and disbursements only if: (a) The plaintiff appears and the defendant fails to appear at the first appearance; (b) The court determines that the complaint complies with ORS 105.115 and 105.124 and is sufficient to state a cause of action for possession; and (c) The plaintiff testifies under oath or submits an affidavit or declaration under penalty of perjury stating that, as of the date of the testimony: (A) The plaintiff does not have knowledge that the defendant has delivered possession to the plaintiff as described in ORS 90.147 (2); and (B) The plaintiff reasonably believes that the defendant remains in possession of the premises. (2) If the defendant appears and the plaintiff fails to appear at the first appearance, a default judgment shall be entered in favor of the defendant dismissing the plaintiffs complaint and awarding costs and disbursements. (3) An attorney at law shall be entitled to appear on behalf of any party, but attorney fees may not be awarded to the plaintiff if the defendant does not contest the action. (4) If the plaintiff dismisses the action before the first appearance, a judgment of dismissal shall be entered in favor of the defendant dismissing the plaintiffs complaint and awarding costs and disbursements. The defendant may not recover attorney fees for prejudgment legal services provided after the delivery of written notice of the dismissal by the plaintiff to the defendant, or to an attorney for the defendant, in the manner provided under ORS 90.155. (5) The plaintiff or an agent of the plaintiff may obtain a continuance of the action for as long as the plaintiff or the agent of the plaintiff deems necessary to obtain the services of an attorney at law. (6) If both parties appear in court on the date contained in the summons, the court shall set the matter for trial unless the court is advised by the parties that the matter has been settled. The trial shall be scheduled: (a) For a claim based on nonpayment, as defined in ORS 90.395, no earlier than 15 days, and no later than 30 days, following the appearance; or (b) For any other claim, as soon as practicable and no later than 15 days from the date of the appearance. (7) If the matter is not tried within the period described in subsection (6) of this section, and the delay in trial is not attributable to the landlord, the court shall order the defendant to pay rent that is accruing into court, provided the court finds after hearing that entry of such an order is just and equitable. (8)(a) The court shall permit an unrepresented defendant to proceed to trial by directing the defendant to file an answer in writing on a form which shall be available from the court clerk, and to serve a copy upon the plaintiff on the same day as first appearance. (b) The answer shall be in substantially the following form: ______________________________________________________________________________ IN THE _________ COURT FOR THE COUNTY OF ____________ (Landlord), ) ) Plaintiff(s), ) ) vs. ) No.___ ) (Tenant), ) ) Defendant(s). ) ANSWER I (we) deny that the plaintiff(s) is (are) entitled to possession because: __ The landlord did not make repairs.

(B) Whether the plaintiff complied with any requirement of the order that is a predicate to compliance by the defendant. (C) Whether the parties agreed to modify the order and complied with the modified order. (D) Whether one party unfairly prevented compliance by the other party. (b) If ORS chapter 90 applies to a dwelling unit, in addition to the issues described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the court may consider the following issues: (A) Whether the stipulated agreement was entered into in good faith as required by ORS 90.130 or is unconscionable as described in ORS 90.135. (B) Whether, for a defendant whose noncompliance concerns performance or conduct, the noncompliance constitutes good cause for purposes of an applicable law or contract that requires the plaintiff to have good cause for terminating the tenancy. (C) Whether, for a defendant whose noncompliance concerns a failure to pay rent due for future rental periods pursuant to ORS 105.146 (2)(c), the defendant has claims against the plaintiff for moneys that offset the rent.

(2) Except for a disclaimer governed by ORS 105.634 or 105.636, the following rules apply to a disclaimer of an interest in property: (a) The disclaimer takes effect when the instrument creating the interest becomes irrevocable or, if the interest arises under the law of intestate succession, when the decedent dies. (b) The disclaimed interest passes according to any provision in the instrument creating the interest providing for the disposition of the specific interest in the event the interest is disclaimed, or according to any provision in the instrument creating the interest providing for the disposition of interests in general in the event the interests created by the instrument are disclaimed. (3) If the instrument creating the interest does not contain a provision described in subsection (2)(b) of this section, or if the interest arises under the law of intestate succession, the following rules apply: (a)(A) If the disclaimant is an individual, except as otherwise provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph, the disclaimed interest passes as if the disclaimant had died immediately before the time of distribution. (B) If by law or under the instrument the descendants of the disclaimant would share in the disclaimed interest by any method of representation had the disclaimant died before the time of distribution, the disclaimed interest passes only to the descendants of the disclaimant who survive the time of distribution. (C) If the disclaimed interest would pass to the disclaimants estate had the disclaimant died before the time of distribution, the disclaimed interest instead passes by representation to the descendants of the disclaimant who survive the time of distribution. If no descendant of the disclaimant survives the time of distribution, the disclaimed interest passes to those persons, including the state, but excluding the disclaimant, and in such shares, as would succeed to the transferors intestate estate under the intestate succession law of the transferors domicile had the transferor died at the time of distribution. However, if the transferors surviving spouse is living but is remarried at the time of distribution, the transferor is deemed to have died unmarried at the time of distribution. (b) If the disclaimant is not an individual, the disclaimed interest passes as if the disclaimant did not exist. (4) Upon the disclaimer of a preceding interest, a future interest held by a person other than the disclaimant takes effect as if the disclaimant had died or ceased to exist immediately before the time of distribution, but a future interest held by the disclaimant is not accelerated in possession or enjoyment.",

If the proceeding in a boundary action involves the location of a public land survey corner as defined by ORS 209.250 (3), the court shall determine the location of the public land survey corner by the following method: (1) The court shall appoint three disinterested commissioners who are registered professional land surveyors, one of whom shall be the county surveyor of the county in which the action is brought, and shall direct the commissioners to go upon the land of the parties and establish and mark out upon the ground the true and correct location of the corner in accordance with ORS 209.070. If the county surveyor of the county in which the action is brought is interested in any tract of land, the title of which is in dispute before the court, the court shall appoint the county surveyor of an adjacent county to serve in lieu of the interested county surveyor. (2) The three commissioners shall establish and monument the true location of the corner in accordance with the current United States Manual of Surveying Instructions. The monument set shall be in accordance with the standards of the county surveyor of the county in which the corner is located. For the purposes of ORS 672.002 (9)(b), the county surveyor shall be the person in responsible charge and shall affix a seal and signature to any plat or report prepared. (3) The county surveyor shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of the survey in accordance with ORS 209.250. (4) The corner, when properly established by the commission, shall be recognized by the court as the legal and permanent corner. The decision of the commission is not subject to appeal. (5) The costs for the services of the three commissioners shall be paid by either the plaintiff or the defendant, or both, as determined by the court.",

(1) Except as provided in ORS 477.089 and 477.092 and subsections (4) to (7) of this section, whenever any person, without lawful authority, willfully injures or severs from the land of another any produce thereof or cuts down, girdles or otherwise injures or carries off any tree, timber or shrub on the land of another person, or of the state, county, United States or any public corporation, or on the street or highway in front of any persons house, or in any village, town or city lot, or cultivated grounds, or on the common or public grounds of any village, town or city, or on the street or highway in front thereof, in an action by such person, village, town, city, the United States, state, county, or public corporation, against the person committing such trespasses if judgment is given for the plaintiff, it shall be given for treble the amount of damages claimed, or assessed for the trespass. In any such action, upon plaintiffs proof of ownership of the premises and the commission by the defendant of any of the acts mentioned in this section, it is prima facie evidence that the acts were committed by the defendant willfully, intentionally and without plaintiffs consent. (2) A court may, in its discretion, award to a prevailing party under subsection (1) of this section reimbursement of reasonable costs of litigation including but not limited to investigation costs and attorney fees. (3) A court may, in its discretion, award to a prevailing plaintiff under subsection (1) of this section reasonable costs of reforestation activities related to the injury sustained by the plaintiff. (4) A contract logger is liable only for actual damages in an action under this section if: (a) The contract logger conducts an operation under a signed, written contract with a person the contract logger reasonably believes to be the legal owner of the produce, trees, timber or shrubs in the operation area; (b) The contract identifies the operation area by a metes and bounds description or other sufficient legal description; (c) Before the contract logger begins harvesting in the operation area, the person who engages the contract logger under the contract: (A) Locates, marks and protects from damage all survey monuments in the operation area; (B) Flags, stakes or otherwise clearly marks the boundaries of the operation area; and (C) Provides the contract logger with a copy of the deed, contract or other instrument that the person who engages the contract logger under the contract relies upon as proof of ownership of the produce, trees, timber or shrubs in the operation area; (d) The contract logger verifies the deed, contract or instrument described in paragraph (c)(C) of this subsection against the metes and bounds description or other sufficient legal description in the contract; (e) The contract logger retains a copy of the deed, contract or instrument described in paragraph (c)(C) of this subsection for at least three years; and (f) The contract logger does not receive written notice that any person has a claim of title to the land or timber in the operation area that is adverse to the person who engages the contract logger under the contract. (5) Subsection (4) of this section does not affect an action for double or treble damages against a contract logger for damages outside the operation area as described in subsection (4) of this section. (6) If an action is brought under this section against a contract logger, and the contract logger was engaged to harvest the timber by a person who purported to own the timber or to have authority to harvest the timber, the person who engaged the contract logger must be joined in the action as a defendant unless jurisdiction over the person cannot be had. If a judgment is entered against the contract logger and against the person who engaged the contract logger, the contract logger shall not be required to pay any part of the judgment unless the plaintiff establishes that the judgment cannot be enforced against the person who engaged the contract logger. The plaintiff may enforce the judgment against the contract logger only if: (a) The plaintiff makes a good faith effort for at least six months after the judgment becomes final and subject to execution to enforce the judgment against the person who engaged the contract logger; and (b) The court determines, upon motion of the plaintiff, that all or part of the judgment cannot be collected from the person who engaged the contract logger. (7) Subsections (2) and (3) of this section apply in an action against a contract logger under subsection (4) of this section. (8) For purposes of this section: (a) Contract logger means a person engaged in a commercial timber harvesting operation. (b) Operation has the meaning given that term in ORS 527.620.",
