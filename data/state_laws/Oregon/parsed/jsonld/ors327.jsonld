(2) In addition to those moneys distributed through the State School Fund, the Department of Education shall award grants under this section to eligible public charter schools from the Statewide Education Initiatives Account. (3) The amount of a grant awarded to an eligible public charter school under this section = the public charter schools ADMw the difference between: (a) The amount of the General Purpose Grant per ADMw for the school district that has contractually established payment for the provision of educational services to the public charter schools students under ORS 338.155 (2) or (3); and (b) The amount of the General Purpose Grant per ADMw that the public charter school receives under a contract for the provision of educational services to the public charter schools students under ORS 338.155 (2) or (3). (4) The purpose of grants distributed under this section shall be to increase academic achievement, including reducing academic disparities, for: (a) Students from racial or ethnic groups that have historically experienced academic disparities, as determined under rules adopted by the State Board of Education; and (b) Students with disabilities. (5) Any eligible public charter school may apply for and receive a grant as provided by this section. A grant application must: (a) Describe how grant moneys will be used to advance the purpose described in subsection (4) of this section. (b) Specify the supports that will be: (A) Provided to students with a disability; or (B) Used to enhance special education and related services that are provided by a school district under ORS 338.165 to the students of the public charter school. (c) Identify any applicable longitudinal performance growth targets for the public charter school that have been established: (A) Under contract between the public charter school and the sponsor of the public charter school; or (B) By the public charter school or the school district in which the public charter school is located for purposes of grants from the Student Investment Account, as provided by ORS 327.190. (d) Be submitted based on the timelines and forms prescribed by the department. (6)(a) If the department determines that a grant application complies with the requirements prescribed under this section, the department shall enter into a grant agreement with the eligible public charter school. (b) A grant agreement must include longitudinal performance growth targets for the public charter school. If the grant application identified longitudinal performance growth targets, those targets shall be included in the grant agreement. If the grant application did not identify longitudinal performance growth targets, the public charter school shall collaborate with the department to develop longitudinal performance growth targets. Longitudinal performance growth targets must: (A) Be based on data available for longitudinal analysis; and (B) Use the following applicable metrics: (i) Third-grade reading proficiency rates, as defined in ORS 327.190; (ii) Regular attendance rates, as defined in ORS 327.190; and (iii) Any other metrics identified by the department in collaboration with the public charter school. (7) After the department and the public charter school have entered into a grant agreement, the department shall award a grant to the public charter school in the amount calculated under subsection (3) of this section. A grant recipient shall deposit grant moneys received under this section into a separate account and shall apply the amounts in that account as provided by the grant agreement. (8)(a) Each year, each grant recipient must submit to the department a description of: (A) How grant moneys received under this section were used to advance the purpose described in subsection (4) of this section and to meet performance growth targets in the grant agreement; and (B) Progress made by the grant recipient toward meeting the performance growth targets in the grant agreement. (b) A grant recipient shall provide the information required under this subsection based on the timelines and forms prescribed by the department. To the greatest extent practicable, the department shall accept the information described in this subsection in the manner that it is made available by a public charter school to the sponsor of the public charter school. (9) To the greatest extent practicable, any requirements prescribed by the department or the board under this section in relation to an application, a grant agreement or the submission of information under subsection (8) of this section shall reduce any redundancies between a grant awarded under this section and a grant awarded from the Student Investment Account. Reduction in redundancies includes accepting for the purposes of grants awarded under this section any applicable forms or information submitted by the public charter school to the department or a school district for the purposes of a grant awarded from the Student Investment Account. (10) A public charter school and a school district may not consider moneys received by the public charter school under this section when establishing payment for the provision of educational services to the public charter schools students under ORS 338.155 (2) or (3). (11) Prior to February 1 of each year, the department shall submit to the appropriate interim legislative committees a report related to the grants awarded under this section. The report must describe: (a) The public charter schools that applied for the grants and the public charter schools that received the grants; (b) The longitudinal performance growth targets included in grant agreements, as provided by subsection (6)(b) of this section; and (c) Progress made toward meeting longitudinal performance growth targets, as reported under subsection (8)(a) of this section. (12) The State Board of Education shall adopt any rules necessary for the distribution of grants under this section. [2021 c.518 16; 2023 c.495 12] (Defibrillator Grants)",

(1) As used in this section: (a) Education service district extended ADMw means the sum of the extended ADMw of the school districts located within the territory of the education service district as computed under ORS 327.013. (b) Local revenues of an education service district means the total of the following: (A) The amount of revenue offset against local property taxes as determined by the Department of Revenue under ORS 311.175 (3)(a)(A); (B) The amount of property taxes actually received by the district including penalties and interest on taxes; (C) The amount of revenue received by the district from state-managed forestlands under ORS 530.115 (1)(b) and (c); and (D) Any positive amount obtained by subtracting the operating property taxes actually imposed by the district based on the rate certified pursuant to ORS 310.060 from the amount that would have been imposed by the district if the district had certified the maximum rate of operating property taxes allowed by law. (2) Each fiscal year, the Superintendent of Public Instruction shall calculate a State School Fund grant for each education service district as provided in this section. (3)(a) Each fiscal year, the superintendent shall calculate the total amount appropriated or allocated to the State School Fund and available for distribution to school districts, education service districts and programs + total amount of local revenues of all school districts, computed as provided in ORS 327.011, + total amount of local revenues of all education service districts. The superintendent may not include in the calculation under this paragraph amounts received by the Department of Education from the State School Fund under ORS 343.243. (b) The superintendent shall multiply the amount calculated under paragraph (a) of this subsection by 95.5 percent. (c) Based on the amount calculated under paragraph (b) of this subsection, the superintendent shall calculate a funding percentage to distribute as nearly as practicable under ORS 327.006 to 327.133, 327.348 and 327.356 to 327.359 the total amount calculated under paragraph (b) of this subsection as school district general purpose grants, high cost disabilities grants and transportation grants to school districts. (d) Based on the funding percentage calculated under paragraph (c) of this subsection, the superintendent shall calculate the general purpose grant, transportation grant and high cost disabilities grant amounts for each school district. (4)(a) The general services grant for an education service district shall equal the higher of: (A) The total amount calculated under subsection (3)(d) of this section for the school districts located within the territory of the education service district (4.5 95.5); or (B) $1,165,000, as adjusted each school year based on the same percentage by which the amount appropriated to the State School Fund for distribution to education service districts is increased or decreased as compared with the amount appropriated for the 2015-2016 school year, if the education service district received a general services grant of $1 million for the 2010-2011 school year. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection and only for State School Fund distributions made for the first school year after two or more education service districts join together, if an education service district received a general services grant as provided by paragraph (a)(B) of this subsection prior to the education service district joining together with one or more other education service districts to form a new education service district: (A) The general services grant for the new education service district shall be calculated for each component education service district as though the component education service districts had not joined together to form a new education service district; and (B) A component education service district that received an amount as provided by paragraph (a)(B) of this subsection shall be entitled to receive that amount under the calculation provided by this paragraph. (5) Subject to subsection (6) of this section, the State School Fund grant for an education service district = general services grant − local revenues of the education service district. (6)(a) After completing the calculations under subsections (2) to (5) of this section, the Superintendent of Public Instruction shall apportion from the State School Fund to each education service district an amount = (funding percentage general services grant) − local revenues of the education service district. (b) The funding percentage used in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be calculated by the superintendent to distribute as nearly as practicable the total amount available for distribution to education service districts from the State School Fund for each fiscal year. (7) Notwithstanding subsections (5) and (6) of this section: (a) The State School Fund grant of an education service district may not be less than zero; and (b) The State School Fund grant of an education service district shall be in an amount that, when combined with the local revenues of the education service district, equals $1,165,000, as adjusted each school year based on the same percentage by which the amount appropriated to the State School Fund for distribution to education service districts is increased or decreased as compared with the amount appropriated for the 2015-2016 school year. (8) An education service district shall distribute to school districts located within the territory of the education service district any amount of local revenues of the education service district that is greater than the general services grant. The amount that each school district receives under this subsection shall be prorated based on the district extended ADMw of the school district as calculated under ORS 327.013. (9)(a) An education service district shall distribute to a school district that is located within the territory of the education service district but that has withdrawn from the education service district as provided in ORS 334.015 the amounts received by the education service district as a general services grant and from the School Improvement Fund. (b) The amounts that a school district receives under this subsection: (A) Shall be prorated based on the district extended ADMw of the school district as calculated under ORS 327.013; (B) Shall equal 90 percent of the school districts prorated share, as calculated under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; and (C) May be used to pay for any expenses incurred in providing services described in ORS 334.175 (2) to the students of the school district by: (i) The school district; (ii) The education service district from which the school district withdrew; (iii) An education service district that is not the education service district from which the school district withdrew; or (iv) Any other public entity with which the school district has entered into a contract to provide the services.",

      "text": "When district required to provide transportation; supplemental plans and waivers. (1) As used in this section, alternative transportation, public transportation and suitable and sufficient have the meanings given those terms in ORS 327.033. (2) A school district is required to provide transportation for elementary school students who reside more than one mile from school and for secondary school students who reside more than 1.5 miles from school. A school district is also required to provide transportation for any student identified in a supplemental plan approved by the State Board of Education. (3)(a) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, the State Board of Education may waive the requirement to provide transportation to elementary and secondary students under paragraph (b) of this subsection. (b) The State Board of Education may waive the requirement to provide transportation: (A) For some or all of the elementary school students who reside more than one mile from school only if the school district that seeks the waiver provides suitable and sufficient alternative transportation to the elementary school students for whom the school district seeks the waiver. A school district that seeks a waiver under this subparagraph must present to the board a plan for providing suitable and sufficient alternative transportation to the elementary school students. Public transportation is not considered suitable and sufficient for elementary school students. (B) For secondary school students who reside more than 1.5 miles from school only if the school district provides or identifies suitable and sufficient alternative transportation for transporting secondary school students. A school district that seeks a waiver under this subparagraph must present to the board a plan for providing or identifying suitable and sufficient alternative transportation for transporting secondary school students. (4) When submitting to the State Board of Education a supplemental plan or a waiver request that includes alternative transportation and that seeks reimbursement for costs incurred in providing alternative transportation, a school district must include: (a) A comparison of: (A) The school districts projected approved transportation costs to serve students without alternative transportation; and (B) The school districts projected approved transportation costs if alternative transportation is approved. (b) For a supplemental plan or a waiver that proposes to use alternative transportation for one or more routes not previously included in a supplemental plan or a waiver, an explanation of why the school district has determined that the use of alternative transportation for the route is necessary. (c) For a waiver request that proposes to use public transportation for secondary school students, an explanation of how: (A) The use of public transportation qualifies for approved transportation costs under ORS 327.033 (2)(c); (B) Any financial support provided by a local transit district according to ORS 184.758 will be used prior to the school district incurring additional expenses; and (C) The school district conducted a good faith effort to hire, train and retain drivers of school buses in a manner that included competitive wages and hiring practices consistent with applicable collective bargaining agreements. (5) The State Board of Education may approve a supplemental plan or a waiver request to use alternative transportation and to provide reimbursement for costs incurred in providing alternative transportation only when: (a) The projected approved transportation costs under subsection (4)(a)(B) of this section are the same as or less than the projected transportation costs under subsection (4)(a)(A) of this section; or (b) The applying school district adequately demonstrates that any expenses incurred in excess of subsection (4)(a)(A) of this section that are attributable to alternative transportation will be paid with funds other than the transportation grant from the State School Fund. (6) Notwithstanding subsection (4) of this section, a school district may request a waiver that includes alternative transportation without providing the additional information required under subsection (4) of this section if the school district does not seek reimbursement for costs incurred in providing the alternative transportation. (7) When the State Board of Education approves a supplemental plan or waiver request to use alternative transportation and provides reimbursement for costs incurred in providing alternative transportation, the approved supplemental plan or waiver shall be effective for two years from the date of approval. (8) Notwithstanding subsections (4), (5) and (7) of this section, a school district that, prior to January 1, 2024, had been receiving reimbursement for costs incurred in providing transit passes under a supplemental plan or a waiver shall continue to receive reimbursement under the terms and conditions the school district was receiving reimbursement prior to January 1, 2024, unless the State Board of Education and the school district agree otherwise. (9) Nothing in this section prevents a school district from providing alternative transportation in addition to otherwise required transportation when no reimbursement is sought for costs incurred in providing the alternative transportation.

The superintendent shall also order the school district in which the public charter school is located not to withhold funds due the public charter school under ORS 338.155. (4) During the preliminary investigation, the school district or public charter school shall cooperate to a reasonable degree with the superintendent and provide any evidence that the superintendent considers necessary for the investigation. If the school district or public charter school fails or refuses to cooperate to a reasonable degree with the superintendent during the investigation, the superintendent shall presume that there is a substantial basis to believe that the school district or public charter school sponsors, financially supports or is actively involved with religious activity and shall proceed as provided in subsection (2) of this section. (5) If the superintendent makes a finding under subsection (2) or (4) of this section, the school district or public charter school shall receive no funds under ORS 327.095 or 338.155 from the date of the superintendents finding until the superintendent finds that the school district or public charter school is no longer sponsoring, financially supporting or actively involved with religious activity. (6) The funds withheld under this section shall be held in an escrow account and shall be removed from that account only as follows: (a) If the superintendent determines, after a contested case hearing, or a court on appeal rules, that the school district or public charter school never sponsored, financially supported or was actively involved with religious activity, the entire amount, including interest thereon, in the escrow account shall be released to the school district or public charter school. (b) If the superintendent determines, after a contested case hearing, or a court on appeal rules, that the school district or public charter school sponsored, financially supported or was actively involved with religious activity in the past but has ceased to do so, that portion of the amount, including interest thereon, in the escrow account that accrued to the school district or public charter school after the school district or public charter school ceased the proscribed conduct shall be paid to the school district or public charter school. Any amount, including interest thereon, permanently withheld from the school district or public charter school shall revert to the State School Fund or to the General Fund, if the biennium has ended. (c) If the school district or public charter school does not cease the proscribed conduct by the beginning of the next school year, the superintendent shall notify the State Treasurer who shall cause the amount in the escrow account, including interest thereon, to revert to the State School Fund or to the General Fund, if the biennium has ended. (7) If the superintendent schedules a contested case hearing, as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the superintendent may conduct such further investigation of the facts relevant to the complaint as the superintendent considers necessary. In conducting the investigation, the superintendent shall have the power of subpoena to compel production of documents and attendance of witnesses at depositions and may do all things necessary to secure a full and thorough investigation. (8) If a person or school district or public charter school fails to comply with any subpoena issued under subsection (7) of this section, a judge of the circuit court of any county, on application of the superintendent, shall compel obedience by proceedings for contempt as in the case of disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued from circuit court.",

(4) A school district may receive and expend moneys distributed from the State School Fund under ORS 327.013 for a program established under this section if the school district meets all of the following criteria: (a) Has a policy for the program that is adopted by the school district board and that describes: (A) The goals of the program, including target high school graduation rates for underserved students; (B) Minimum requirements for grade point average, attendance and participation in regular in-person meetings with school district staff to monitor student progress; (C) The manner by which the results of the program will be measured and monitored; and (D) The courses of study that are approved by the school district for the purpose of this section. (b) Enters into a written agreement with the community college that has a service area within which the school district is located. (c) Has dedicated staff to provide support services to post-graduate scholars, including regular in-person meetings to monitor student progress that occur at least twice each month.

(6) For purposes of this section, a school district may not counsel or assist a student to delay receiving a high school diploma or a modified diploma for the purpose of participating in a school-sponsored, post-secondary education program. (7) Nothing in this section: (a) Prohibits a school district from receiving or expending moneys related to the education of post-graduate scholars that are not received or expended for purposes of this section, as long as the school district does not receive or expend State School Fund distributions under ORS 327.013 for those purposes. (b) Requires a post-graduate scholar to accept or use any federal grant moneys to offset costs of tuition, fees or books incurred by a post-graduate scholar at a community college.

(8) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, a post-graduate scholar may not accept or use any federal grant moneys to offset costs of tuition, fees or books incurred by a post-graduate scholar at a community college. (9) A school district may receive or expend moneys distributed from the State School Fund under ORS 327.013 for post-graduate scholars who enroll in courses at a community college only if the post-graduate scholars are enrolled in the courses as part of a program established under this section.",

(b) Local option tax rate means the amount of local option taxes imposed by the school district for the current fiscal year, after compression under ORS 310.150 and after subtraction of the amount of school district local option taxes that are distributed to an urban renewal agency pursuant to ORS 457.440, divided by the assessed value of the school district. (c) School district means a common or union high school district. (d) Target district means the school district that, for the fiscal year prior to the year for which grants are being determined, had a total assessed value of taxable property per district extended ADMw that was greater than all but 25 percent of the school districts in this state for that prior fiscal year. The Department of Education shall determine which school district is the target district for a fiscal year, based on the total assessed values of school districts reported to the Department of Education by the Department of Revenue for the fiscal year prior to the year for which grants are being determined under this section. (2) A school district shall receive a local option equalization grant for a fiscal year: (a) In which the school district imposes local option taxes pursuant to ORS 280.040 to 280.145; and (b) For which the total assessed value of taxable property per extended ADMw of the school district for the prior fiscal year does not exceed the total assessed value of taxable property per extended ADMw of the target district for the prior fiscal year. (3) The amount of the local option equalization grant shall equal the lesser of: (a) The product of the local option tax rate of the school district for the current fiscal year (total assessed value per extended ADMw of the target district for the prior fiscal year − total assessed value per extended ADMw of the school district for the prior fiscal year) the extended ADMw of the school district for the prior fiscal year; or (b) The amount obtained by subtracting the local option tax imposed by the school district for the current fiscal year, after compression under ORS 310.150, from the lesser of: (A) Twenty percent of the combined total for the school district of the general purpose grant, the transportation grant and the high cost disabilities grant of the school district for the current fiscal year; or (B) $1,000 multiplied by the extended ADMw of the school district for the current fiscal year. The amount multiplied by the extended ADMw of the school district shall be increased each fiscal year by three percent above the amount allowed for the prior fiscal year. (4) If the amount computed under subsection (3)(b) of this section is zero or less, a local option equalization grant may not be made to the school district for the fiscal year. (5) As soon as is practicable after school districts have certified property taxes to the assessor under ORS 310.060, the Department of Revenue shall report to the Department of Education a list of school districts certifying local option taxes for the current fiscal year and the local option tax rates for those districts. The amount of each local option equalization grant shall be calculated by the Department of Education. (6) If the election authorizing the imposition of a local option tax is held after the start of a biennium in which the local option tax is to be imposed, the local option equalization grant for a fiscal year of that biennium shall be determined as otherwise prescribed in this section, but may not be paid to the school district until the first fiscal year of the next succeeding biennium.",

Add. Sections 2 and 4 of this 2022 Act are added to and made a part of ORS chapter 327. [2022 c.43 1] Sec. 2. Grants for wildfire-impacted school districts; rules. (1) As used in this section: (a) ADMw means the weighted average daily membership of a school district, as calculated under ORS 327.013 (1)(c)(A), minus any ADMw attributable to a virtual public charter school, as defined in ORS 338.005. (b) District ADM means the average daily membership, as defined in ORS 327.006, for a school district, minus any ADM attributable to a virtual public charter school, as defined in ORS 338.005. (c) District extended ADMw means the ADMw or ADMw of the prior year, whichever is greater. (d) 2020 wildfires includes all wildfires that were identified in an executive order issued by the Governor in accordance with the Emergency Conflagration Act under ORS 476.510 to 476.610 between August 1 and September 30, 2020. (2) In addition to distributions made from the State School Fund and the Student Investment Account and apportionments made from the High School Graduation and College and Career Readiness Fund, the Department of Education shall award grants each school year to wildfire-impacted school districts as provided by this section. (3) A school district may apply for a grant under this section if: (a) The district ADM, as compared to the district ADM for the 2019-2020 school year, decreased for any school year occurring after the 2019-2020 school year; and (b) The school district can demonstrate that one or more of the following occurred: (A) One or more school buildings of the school district were damaged as the result of the 2020 wildfires and that damage resulted in students being displaced from the building or the building being closed to students; (B) Housing within the boundaries of the school district was damaged as a result of the 2020 wildfires and that damage resulted in students being displaced from the school district; or (C) Any other circumstances identified by the State Board of Education by rule as being directly related to the 2020 wildfires and causing a decrease in the district ADM. (4)(a) Except as provided by subsection (5) of this section, the amount of a grant awarded under this section shall equal the greater of the sum calculated under paragraph (b) or (c) of this subsection. (b) The following shall be added to determine the difference in amounts distributed to a school district based on ADMw: (A) The difference between the following, in relation to distributions from the State School Fund under ORS 327.013: (i) The amount that would have been distributed to the school district for the current school year from the State School Fund under ORS 327.013, as calculated based on the district extended ADMw for the 2019-2020 school year; and (ii) The amount actually distributed to the school district for the current school year from the State School Fund under ORS 327.013, as calculated based on the district extended ADMw for the current school year; (B) The difference between the following, in relation to distributions from the Student Investment Account under ORS 327.195: (i) The amount that would have been distributed to the school district for the current school year from the Student Investment Account under ORS 327.195, as calculated based on the district extended ADMw for the 2019-2020 school year; and (ii) The amount actually distributed to the school district for the current school year from the Student Investment Account under ORS 327.195, as calculated based on the district extended ADMw for the current school year; and (C) The difference between the following, in relation to apportionments from the High School Graduation and College and Career Readiness Fund under ORS 327.859: (i) The amount that would have been apportioned to the school district for the current school year from the High School Graduation and College and Career Readiness Fund under ORS 327.859, as calculated based on the district extended ADMw for the 2019-2020 school year; and (ii) The amount actually apportioned to the school district for the current school year from the High School Graduation and College and Career Readiness Fund under ORS 327.859, as calculated based on the district extended ADMw for the current school year. (c) The following shall be added to determine the difference in amounts distributed to a school district based on district ADM: (A) The difference between the following, in relation to distributions from the State School Fund under ORS 327.013: (i) The amount that would have been distributed to the school district for the current school year from the State School Fund under ORS 327.013, as calculated based on the district ADM for the 2019-2020 school year; and (ii) The amount actually distributed to the school district for the current school year from the State School Fund under ORS 327.013, as calculated based on the district ADM for the current school year; (B) The difference between the following, in relation to distributions from the Student Investment Account under ORS 327.195: (i) The amount that would have been distributed to the school district for the current school year from the Student Investment Account under ORS 327.195, as calculated based on the district ADM for the 2019-2020 school year; and (ii) The amount actually distributed to the school district for the current school year from the Student Investment Account under ORS 327.195, as calculated based on the district ADM for the current school year; and (C) The difference between the following, in relation to apportionments from the High School Graduation and College and Career Readiness Fund under ORS 327.859: (i) The amount that would have been apportioned to the school district for the current school year from the High School Graduation and College and Career Readiness Fund under ORS 327.859, as calculated based on the district ADM for the 2019-2020 school year; and (ii) The amount actually apportioned to the school district for the current school year from the High School Graduation and College and Career Readiness Fund under ORS 327.859, as calculated based on the district ADM for the current school year. (5) The department may prorate the amount of a grant calculated under subsection (4) of this section if the department finds, based on rules adopted by the State Board of Education, that only a portion of the decrease in district ADM, as compared to the 2019-2020 school year, is attributable to the 2020 wildfires. (6) A school district may qualify for a grant under this section only for school years in which the district ADM for the current school year is less than the district ADM for the 2019-2020 school year. (7)(a) The department shall award grants under this section from moneys available in the School Stabilization Subaccount for Wildfire-impacted School Districts established under section 4 of this 2022 Act. (b) When awarding a grant, the department shall identify the portion of the grant that is attributable to: (A) Distributions from the State School Fund under ORS 327.013; (B) Distributions from the Student Investment Account under ORS 327.195; and (C) Apportionments from the High School Graduation and College and Career Readiness Fund under ORS 327.859. (c) A school district that receives a grant under this section shall use the portions of the grant for the purposes for which the portions were intended, including: (A) Using the portion of the grant attributable to distributions from the Student Investment Account in a manner that is consistent with how the school district uses other distributions from the account; and (B) Using the portion of the grant attributable to apportionments from the High School Graduation and College and Career Readiness Fund in a manner that is consistent with how the school district uses other apportionments from the fund. (8) The State Board of Education shall adopt any rules necessary for the administration of this section, including adopting a reporting requirement to ensure compliance with the provisions of subsection (7)(c) of this section. [2022 c.43 2] Sec. 3. Applicable school years. (1) Section 2 of this 2022 Act applies to State School Fund and Student Investment Account distributions and to High School Graduation and College and Career Readiness Fund apportionments made for the 2021-2022, 2022-2023, 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 school years.
