(2)(a) For purposes of the tax credits contained in this chapter, any term has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in the laws of the United States relating to federal income taxes, unless a different meaning is clearly required or the term is specifically defined for purposes of construing, interpreting and applying the credit. (b) With respect to the tax credits contained in this chapter, any reference to the laws of the United States or to the Internal Revenue Code means the laws of the United States relating to income taxes or the Internal Revenue Code as they are amended on or before December 31, 2022, even when the amendments take effect or become operative after that date. (3) Insofar as is practicable in the administration of this chapter, the Department of Revenue shall apply and follow the administrative and judicial interpretations of the federal income tax law. When a provision of the federal income tax law is the subject of conflicting opinions by two or more federal courts, the department shall follow the rule observed by the United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue until the conflict is resolved. Nothing contained in this section limits the right or duty of the department to audit the return of any taxpayer or to determine any fact relating to the tax liability of any taxpayer. (4) When portions of the Internal Revenue Code incorporated by reference as provided in subsection (2) of this section refer to rules or regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, then such rules or regulations shall be regarded as rules adopted by the department under and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, whenever they are prescribed or amended. (5)(a) When portions of the Internal Revenue Code incorporated by reference as provided in subsection (2) of this section are later corrected by an Act or a Title within an Act of the United States Congress designated as an Act or Title making technical corrections, then notwithstanding the date that the Act or Title becomes law, those portions of the Internal Revenue Code, as so corrected, shall be the portions of the Internal Revenue Code incorporated by reference as provided in subsection (2) of this section and shall take effect, unless otherwise indicated by the Act or Title (in which case the provisions shall take effect as indicated in the Act or Title), as if originally included in the provisions of the Act being technically corrected. If, on account of this subsection, any adjustment is required to an Oregon return that would otherwise be prevented by operation of law or rule, the adjustment shall be made, notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, in the manner provided under ORS 314.135. (b) As used in this subsection, Act or Title includes any subtitle, division or other part of an Act or Title.",

(4) A contributor remains eligible to receive a credit under this section even if the owner or operator of the agriculture workforce housing becomes ineligible for the credit as a result of: (a) Failure to file the annual certification under ORS 315.164 (6); (b) Failure to continue to substantially comply with occupational safety or health laws, rules, regulations or standards under ORS 315.164 (10); (c) Failure to register as a farmworker camp with the Department of Consumer and Business Services under ORS 658.750; (d) Failure of the operator to hold a valid indorsement as a farmworker camp operator under ORS 658.730; or (e) Failure to comply with any other rules or provisions relating to the operation or maintenance of the agriculture workforce housing after work on the agriculture workforce housing project has been completed. (5)(a) The credit allowed under this section may be taken for the tax year in which the agriculture workforce housing project is completed or in any of the nine tax years succeeding the tax year in which the project is completed. (b) The credit allowed in any one tax year may not exceed 20 percent of the amount determined under subsection (2) of this section that was transferred to the contributor claiming the credit. (6) Except as provided under subsection (7) of this section, the credit allowed in any one year may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer. (7) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular tax year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayers tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise any credit not used in that second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that third succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fourth succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that fourth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fifth succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that fifth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the sixth succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that sixth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the seventh succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that seventh succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the eighth succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that eighth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the ninth succeeding tax year, but may not be carried forward for any tax year thereafter. (8)(a) A nonresident individual shall be allowed the credit computed in the same manner and subject to the same limitations as the credit allowed a resident by this section. However, the credit shall be prorated using the proportion provided in ORS 316.117. (b) If a change in the tax year of a taxpayer occurs as described in ORS 314.085, or if the Department of Revenue terminates the taxpayers tax year under ORS 314.440, the credit allowed by this section shall be prorated or computed in a manner consistent with ORS 314.085. (c) If a change in the status of a taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit allowed by this section shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117.

      "text": "considered necessary by the State Forester to establish commercial, hardwood or softwood stands on appropriate sites. Subject to subsection (5) of this section: (a) One-half of the credit shall be taken in the tax year for which the State Forester, after physical inspection of the forestland, issues a preliminary certificate under ORS 315.106 certifying that the land qualifies as underproductive Oregon forestland and that the reforestation project undertaken meets the requirements of this section and the specifications established by the State Forester and the costs appear to be reasonable; and (b) One-half of the credit shall be taken in the tax year for which the State Forester, after further physical inspection of the land and project, certifies that the new forest is established in accordance with the specifications of the State Forester. (2) No credit shall be allowed under either subsection (1)(a) or (b) of this section unless written certification containing the following statements accompanies the claim for the credit or is otherwise filed with the Department of Revenue: (a) A preliminary certificate issued by the State Forester under ORS 315.106 that the land and project meet the preliminary specifications established by the State Forester or that the new forest is established, whichever is applicable at the time. (b) A statement by the landowner or person in possession of the land that the land within the project area will be used for the primary purpose of growing and harvesting trees of an acceptable species. (c) A statement that the landowner or person in possession of the land is aware that maintenance practices, including release, may be needed to insure that a new forest is established and will remain established. (3) For purposes of this section, reforestation project costs shall not include: (a) Costs paid or incurred to reforest any forestland that has been commercially logged to the extent that reforestation is required under the Oregon Forest Practices Act, except costs paid or incurred to reforest forestland following a hardwood harvest, conducted for the purposes of converting underproductive forestlands, as determined by administrative rule. (b) That portion of costs or expenses paid through a federal or state cost share, financial assistance or other incentive program. (c) Those costs paid or incurred to grow Christmas trees, ornamental trees, shrubs or plants, or those costs paid or incurred to grow hardwood timber described under ORS 321.267 (3) or 321.824 (3). (d) Any costs paid or incurred to purchase or otherwise acquire the land. (e) The cost of purchase or other acquisition of tools and equipment with a useful life of more than one year. (4) To qualify for the credit: (a) The project must be completed to specifications approved by the State Forester. (b) The taxpayers portion of the project costs must be $500 or more. (c) The taxpayer must be a private individual, corporation, group, Indian tribe or other native group, association or other nonpublic legal entity owning, purchasing under recorded contract of sale or leasing at least five acres of Oregon commercial forestland. (d) Prior to December 31, 2012, the taxpayer must file with the State Forester a written request for preliminary certification under ORS 315.106. (5) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section which is not used by the taxpayer in a particular year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayers tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in such next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year, but may not be carried forward for any tax year thereafter. In all cases the taxpayer must be the person who made the investment into the project. (6) The credit provided by this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any depreciation or amortization deduction to which the taxpayer otherwise may be entitled with respect to the reforestation project and the credit shall not affect the computation of basis for the property. (7) In compliance with ORS chapter 183, the Department of Revenue and the State Forestry Department may adopt rules consistent with law for carrying out the provisions of this section. (8) As used in this section, underproductive Oregon forestlands means Oregon commercial forestlands not meeting the minimum stocking standards of the Oregon Forest Practices Act. (9) If, for any reason other than those specified in subsection (10) of this section, a new forest is not established by the last day of the second taxable year following the taxable year for which the preliminary certificate was issued, the State Forester shall so report to the Department of Revenue. The report filed under this subsection shall be the basis for the department to recover any credit granted under subsection (1)(a) of this section. If, however, the new forest is not established within the time required by this subsection on account of the reasons specified in subsection (10) of this section, any credit allowed under subsections (1)(a) and (5) of this section shall not be recovered but no further credit as provided under subsections (1)(b) and (5) of this section shall be allowed. (10) Subject to requalification under this section in the manner applicable for the original claim, including obtaining a new preliminary certificate, a taxpayer may claim an additional credit or credits for reestablishing a new planting in the event that the new forest is destroyed by a natural disaster or is not established for reasons beyond the control of the taxpayer, if the measures taken in completing the original or earlier project would normally have resulted in establishing the minimum number of trees per acre anticipated by the project. (11) Any owner affected by a determination, regarding the reforestation tax credit made by: (a) The State Forester, except for a denial of a request for a preliminary certificate due to the annual reforestation credit cost limitation calculated under ORS 315.108, may appeal that determination in the manner provided for in ORS 526.475 (1). (b) The Department of Revenue, may appeal that determination in the manner provided for in ORS 526.475 (2).

      "text": "Voluntary removal of riparian land from farm production; rules. (1) As used in this section: (a) Crop means the total yearly production of an agricultural commodity, not including livestock, that is harvested from a specified area. (b) Riparian land means land in this state that: (A) Borders both a river, stream or other natural watercourse and land that is in farm production; and (B) Does not exceed a width of 35 feet between the land that is in farm production and the bank of the river, stream or other natural watercourse. (c) Share-rent agreement means an agreement in which the person who engages in farming operations and the person who owns the land where the farming operations are conducted share the crop grown on that land or the profits from that crop. (2) A taxpayer may claim a credit against the taxes otherwise due under ORS chapter 316, 317 or 318 for 75 percent of the market value of crops forgone when riparian land is voluntarily taken out of farm production. (3) A credit under this section may be claimed only if: (a) The taxpayer owns the riparian land that is the basis of the credit; (b) The taxpayer is actively engaged in farming operations on land adjacent to the riparian land; (c) The riparian land was in farm production for the previous tax year or a credit under this section was claimed during the previous tax year; (d) The conservation practices employed on the riparian land are consistent with the agricultural water quality management plan administered by the State Department of Agriculture in the applicable river basin management area; and (e) The decision to remove the riparian land from farm production was a voluntary decision and not the result of a federal, state or local law or government decision requiring the riparian land to be taken out of farm production. For purposes of this paragraph, action taken by a taxpayer under an agricultural water quality management plan administered by the State Department of Agriculture is not the result of a government decision requiring the land to be taken out of farm production. (4)(a) The amount of the credit shall be calculated by multiplying the market value per acre of the forgone crop by the acreage of the riparian land that is not in farm production and multiplying that product by 75 percent. (b) For the first tax year for which a credit is claimed under this section, the forgone crop for which a value is determined under this section shall be the crop grown on the land in the previous tax year. (c) For a tax year following the first tax year for which a credit is claimed under this section, the forgone crop for which a value is determined under this section shall be the crop for which the value was determined for the previous tax year. (d) If a taxpayer does not claim a credit under this section for a tax year, any credit claimed in a subsequent tax year shall be treated as the first tax year for which a credit is claimed under this section. (5) Notwithstanding subsection (3)(a) and (b) of this section, if the riparian land that is the basis of a credit under this section is adjacent to land that is in farm production under a share-rent agreement, the taxpayer that is engaged in farming operations and the taxpayer that is the landowner may each claim a credit under this section. The amount of the credit shall be allocated to each taxpayer in the proportion that the share-rent agreement allocates crop proceeds to each of those taxpayers. The total amount of credit allowed to both taxpayers under this subsection may not exceed the amount of the credit otherwise allowable under this section if the farming operations were not subject to a share-rent agreement. (6) Notwithstanding subsections (3)(a) and (5) of this section, if the taxpayer is actively engaged in farming operations and pays the landowner in cash, the taxpayer may claim all of the credit available under this section. (7) The credit allowed in any one tax year may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer. (8) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular tax year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayers tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the third succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fourth succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the fourth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fifth succeeding tax year, but may not be used in any tax year thereafter. (9) In the case of a credit allowed under this section for purposes of ORS chapter 316: (a) A nonresident shall be allowed the credit in the same manner and subject to the same limitations as a resident. However, the credit shall be prorated using the proportion provided in ORS 316.117. (b) If a change in the taxable year of a taxpayer occurs as described in ORS 314.085 or if the Department of Revenue terminates the taxpayers taxable year under ORS 314.440, the credit allowed by this section shall be prorated or computed in a manner consistent with ORS 314.085. (c) If a change in the status of a taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit allowed by this section shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117. (10) If a taxpayer that has claimed a credit under this section places the riparian land for which the credit is claimed back in farm production, the taxpayer may not claim a credit under this section for five tax years following the year the riparian land was placed back in farm production. (11) The Department of Revenue may adopt rules prescribing procedures for identifying forgone crops and for establishing the market value of forgone crops. [2001 c.912 3; 2003 c.46 32] Note: Section 6, chapter 913, Oregon Laws 2009, provides: Sec. 6. Except as provided in ORS 315.113 (8), a credit may not be claimed under ORS",

(e) Qualified machinery and equipment means machinery and equipment used in processing that meets the requirements of subsections (3) and (4) of this section for the tax year. (2) A taxpayer who is a farm operator may claim a credit against the taxes that are otherwise due under ORS chapter 316 or, if the taxpayer is a corporation, under ORS chapter 317 or 318 for ad valorem property taxes paid or incurred on qualified machinery and equipment. (3) A credit under this section may be claimed only if: (a) The machinery and equipment is owned by the farm operator or by a person who is related to the farm operator under section 267 of the Internal Revenue Code; (b) The machinery and equipment is used for processing primarily occurring on land described in subsection (4) of this section; and (c)(A) The farm operator has grown or raised at least one-half of the total volume of farm crop or livestock products processed with the machinery and equipment for which the credit is being claimed in three of the five previous income tax years; or (B)(i) The farm operator has grown or raised at least one-tenth of the total volume of farm crop or livestock products processed with the machinery and equipment for which the credit is being claimed in three of the five previous income tax years; and (ii) The farm operator has used the machinery and equipment to process at least one-half of the volume of the applicable farm crop or livestock products grown or raised by the farm operator in three of the five previous income tax years. (4) In addition to the requirements under subsection (3) of this section, a credit under this section may be claimed only if: (a) The machinery and equipment is located on land that is specially assessed for farm use under ORS 308A.050 to 308A.128 and the machinery and equipment is owned or otherwise controlled by the farm operator; or (b) The machinery and equipment is located on land that is contiguous to land that is specially assessed for farm use under ORS 308A.050 to 308A.128 and the machinery and equipment is owned or otherwise controlled by the farm operator. (5) A credit may be claimed under this section only for qualified machinery and equipment that was subject to assessment and property taxation for the property tax year beginning in the income tax year for which the credit is being claimed. (6) The amount of the credit shall be the lesser of: (a) The effective property tax rate multiplied by the adjusted basis of the qualified machinery and equipment; or (b) $30,000. (7) The adjusted basis of the qualified machinery and equipment shall be the adjusted basis of the qualified machinery and equipment for personal income or corporate excise or income tax purposes as of the last day of the income tax year for which the credit is being claimed, except that the adjusted basis shall be increased by the cost of any qualified machinery and equipment that the taxpayer elected to expense under section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code, until the qualified machinery and equipment is fully depreciated for personal income or corporate excise or income tax purposes. The adjusted basis shall reflect any depreciation allowable for the current tax year. A credit under this section may not be allowed for a tax year in which the qualified machinery and equipment is fully depreciated for personal income or corporate excise or income tax purposes. (8) The credit allowed under this section for any one tax year may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer. (9) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayers tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that third succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fourth succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that fourth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fifth succeeding tax year, but may not be carried forward for any tax year thereafter. (10) The credit allowed under this section is not in lieu of any depreciation or amortization deduction to which the taxpayer otherwise may be entitled under ORS chapter 316, 317 or 318 for the tax year. (11) The taxpayers adjusted basis for determining gain or loss may not be further decreased by any amount of credit allowed under this section. (12) A nonresident shall be allowed the credit under this section in the proportion provided in ORS 316.117. (13) If a change in the status of a taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit allowed under this section shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117. (14) If a change in the taxable year of a taxpayer occurs as described in ORS 314.085, or if the Department of Revenue terminates the taxpayers taxable year under ORS 314.440, the credit allowed under this section shall be prorated or computed in a manner consistent with ORS 314.085.

(2)(a) A credit against taxes that are otherwise due under ORS chapter 316 or, if the taxpayer is a corporation, under ORS chapter 317 or 318 is allowed to a taxpayer that is a small forestland owner that is eligible to conduct a timber harvest using a small forest owner minimum option and elects to use standard practice harvest restrictions instead. The credit shall be allowed for the tax year in which the timber harvest is completed. (b) A credit under this section may not be transferred to a successor forestland owner. (3) In order to be eligible for a credit under this section, a small forestland owner must: (a) Have harvested not more than two million board feet of merchantable forest products from forestland in this state owned by the small forestland owner, as averaged over the three years immediately preceding the date of filing a notification of operation as described in ORS 315.126; (b) Conduct a timber harvest in an area that is: (A) Adjacent to a riparian area subject to the Oregon Forest Practices Act; and (B) Equal in size to or larger than that portion of the forest conservation area that the small forestland owner elects not to harvest and upon which the small forestland owner claims the credit; and (c) Abide by the standard practice harvest restrictions, which shall remain in effect for the forest conservation area for which the small forestland owner claims the credit for 50 years beginning with the date on which the certification is issued under ORS 315.126. (4) The amount of the credit allowed under this section shall be based on the stumpage value of timber within the forest conservation area and shall be calculated as provided in ORS 315.128. (5) Prior to claiming the credit allowed under this section, a small forestland owner is required to receive written certification of eligibility from the State Forestry Department, as provided in ORS 315.126.

(2) The certified stumpage value described in subsection (1)(a) of this section shall be multiplied by 125 percent if the small forestland owner: (a) Is barred from using the small forest owner minimum option by the horizontal lineal feet limitation applicable to fifth field watersheds; or (b)(A) Is operating on a parcel of land that is significantly disproportionately impacted by rules adopted under ORS 527.610 to 527.770, as determined by the State Forester; and (B) Has a federal adjusted gross income, as described in ORS 316.013, of not more than 125 percent of the Oregon median household income, as averaged over the three previous tax years. (3) The applicable stumpage values under this section shall be the values as of the date of filing a notification of operation under ORS 527.670, as described in ORS 315.126 (1)(a), and shall be calculated using one of the following methods: (a) The conversion return method, in which the volume of timber being retained is determined by species and log grades, and a value is established from current delivered log price information, less a reasonable cost for harvest and delivery, for the area in which the retained timber would ordinarily be sold. (b) The actual comparison method, which may be used if the timber being retained is similar in species and log grades to the timber being harvested, and which is calculated using actual revenues from the timber being harvested by the small forestland owner in the harvest area adjacent to the forest conservation area. (c) The cash flow modeling method, in which the value of standing timber is determined by using the projected volume of the stand over a harvest rotation based on species and site class, determining the value at harvest age and then discounting the value to the present date using an interest rate equal to the direct farm ownership loan interest rate of the Farm Service Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture. (4) Costs, including the cost of an appraisal and the cost of filing and recording a deed restriction, may be included in the credit amount only to the extent that the amount attributable to those costs is not claimed as an income tax deduction by the taxpayer.",

      "text": "Screening devices, by-pass devices or fishways; rules. (1) There shall be allowed a credit against tax due under ORS chapter 316, or if the taxpayer is a corporation, under ORS chapter 317, for taxpayers that install screening devices, by-pass devices or fishways, pursuant to ORS 498.306 or 509.585, and the diversion is not part of a hydroelectric project required to be licensed under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Except as allowed in subsection (4) of this section, the credit shall be taken in the tax year in which the final certification is issued under subsection (10) of this section. (2) The credit shall be equal to 50 percent of the taxpayers net certified costs of installing a screening device, by-pass device or fishway. The total credit allowed may not exceed $5,000 per device installed. (3) The credit allowed in any one year may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer. (4) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section which is not used by the taxpayer in a particular tax year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayers tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in such next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in such second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in such third succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fourth succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in such fourth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fifth succeeding tax year, but may not be used in any tax year thereafter. (5) The credit provided by this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any depreciation or amortization deduction to which the taxpayer otherwise may be entitled with respect to the installation of a screening device, by-pass device or fishway. The taxpayers adjusted basis for determining gain or loss may not be further decreased by any tax credits allowed under this section. (6) In the case of a credit allowed under this section for purposes of ORS chapter 316: (a) A nonresident shall be allowed the credit in the same manner and subject to the same limitations as a resident. However, the credit shall be prorated using the proportion provided in ORS 316.117. (b) If a change in the tax year of a taxpayer occurs as described in ORS 314.085, or if the Department of Revenue terminates the taxpayers tax year under ORS 314.440, the credit allowed by this section shall be prorated or computed in a manner consistent with ORS 314.085. (c) If a change in the status of a taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit allowed by this section shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117. (7) To qualify for the credit the taxpayer must be issued a certificate by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife. (8) To obtain credit under subsection (1) of this section, any person proposing to apply for certification of a screening device, by-pass device or fishway, before installing the screening device, by-pass device or fishway, shall file a request for preliminary certification with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife. The request shall be in a form prescribed by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife. The following conditions shall apply: (a) Within 30 days of the receipt of a request for preliminary certification, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife may require, as a condition precedent to issuance of a preliminary certificate of approval, the submission of plans and specifications. After examination thereof, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife may request corrections and revisions to the plans and specifications. The State Department of Fish and Wildlife may also require any pertinent information necessary to determine whether the proposed screening device, by-pass device or fishway is in accordance with State Department of Fish and Wildlife requirements. (b) If the State Department of Fish and Wildlife determines that the proposed screening device, by-pass device or fishway is in accordance with State Department of Fish and Wildlife requirements, it shall issue a preliminary certificate approving the screening device, by-pass device or fishway. If the State Department of Fish and Wildlife determines that the screening device, by-pass device or fishway does not comply with State Department of Fish and Wildlife requirements, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife shall issue an order denying certification. (c) If within 90 days of the receipt of plans, specifications or any subsequently requested revisions or corrections to the plans and specifications or any other information required pursuant to this section, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife fails to issue a preliminary certificate of approval and the State Department of Fish and Wildlife fails to issue an order denying certification, the preliminary certificate shall be considered to have been issued. The capital investment must comply with the plans, specifications and any corrections or revisions thereto, if any, previously submitted. (d) Within 30 days from the date of mailing of the order, any person against whom an order is directed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection may demand a hearing. The demand shall be in writing, shall state the grounds for hearing and shall be mailed to the State Fish and Wildlife Director. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of ORS chapter 183. (9) A screening device, by-pass device or fishway that is installed by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife pursuant to ORS 498.306 (8) in response to noncompliance by the person responsible for the water diversion is not eligible for the credit provided in subsection (1) of this section. (10) Upon completion and pursuant to application for final certification, final certification shall be issued by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife if the screening device, by-pass device or fishway was constructed and installed in accordance with State Department of Fish and Wildlife requirements. Final certification shall include a statement of the costs of installation as verified by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife. The credit allowed under this section shall be claimed first for the tax year of the taxpayer in which final certification is issued. (11) The State Department of Fish and Wildlife shall provide information to the Department of Revenue about all certifications issued under this section, if required by ORS 315.058. (12) The State Fish and Wildlife Director may order the suspension or revocation of a certification issued under this section, as provided in ORS 315.061, for the reasons set forth in ORS 315.061 or if the holder of the certificate fails to meet State Department of Fish and Wildlife requirements. (13) In the event that the screening device, by-pass device or fishway is destroyed by flood, natural disaster or act of God before all of the credit has been used, the taxpayer may nevertheless claim the credit as if no destruction had taken place. (14) Screening devices, by-pass devices or fishways that are financed by funds obtained from the Water Development Fund, pursuant to ORS 541.700 to 541.855, are not eligible for the credit under any circumstances. (15) The State Department of Fish and Wildlife shall adopt rules for carrying out the provisions of this section and report to the interim committee created under ORS 171.605 to 171.640 to make studies of and inquiries into state revenue matters.

(1) A taxpayer who is the owner or operator of agriculture workforce housing is allowed a credit against the taxes otherwise due under ORS chapter 316, if the taxpayer is a resident individual, or against the taxes otherwise due under ORS chapter 317, if the taxpayer is a corporation. The total amount of the credit shall be equal to 50 percent of the eligible costs actually paid or incurred by the taxpayer to complete an agriculture workforce housing project, to the extent the eligible costs actually paid or incurred by the taxpayer do not exceed the estimate of eligible costs approved by the Housing and Community Services Department under ORS 315.167. (2) A taxpayer who is otherwise eligible to claim a credit under this section may elect to transfer all or a portion of the credit to a contributor in the manner provided in ORS 315.169. (3)(a) The credit allowed under this section may be taken for the tax year in which the agriculture workforce housing project is completed or in any of the nine tax years succeeding the tax year in which the project is completed. (b) The credit allowed in any one tax year may not exceed 20 percent of the amount determined under subsection (1) of this section. (4)(a) To claim a credit under this section, a taxpayer must show in each year following the completion of an agriculture workforce housing project that the housing continues to be operated as agriculture workforce housing. (b) A taxpayer need not make the showing required in paragraph (a) of this subsection if the Housing and Community Services Department waives the requirement after the taxpayer has successfully met the requirement for the first five years after completion of the agriculture workforce housing project. (c) The Housing and Community Services Department shall determine by rule the factors necessary to grant a waiver. Such factors may include a documented decline in a particular area for agriculture workforce housing. (5) The credit shall apply only to an agriculture workforce housing project that is located within this state and physically begun on or after January 1, 1990. (6)(a) A credit may not be allowed under this section unless the taxpayer claiming credit under this section: (A) Obtains a letter of credit approval from the Housing and Community Services Department pursuant to ORS 315.167; and (B) Files with the Housing and Community Services Department an annual certification providing that all occupied units for which credit is being claimed are occupied by agricultural workers, including agricultural workers who are retired or disabled, and their immediate families. (b) The certification described under this subsection shall be made on the form and in the time and manner prescribed by the Housing and Community Services Department. (7) Except as provided under subsection (8) of this section, the credit allowed in any one year may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer. (8) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular tax year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayers tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise any credit not used in that second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that third succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fourth succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that fourth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fifth succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that fifth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the sixth succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that sixth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the seventh succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that seventh succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the eighth succeeding tax year, and any credit not used in that eighth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the ninth succeeding tax year, but may not be carried forward for any tax year thereafter. (9)(a) The credit provided by this section is not in lieu of any depreciation or amortization deduction for the agriculture workforce housing project to which the taxpayer otherwise may be entitled under ORS chapter 316 or 317 for the year. (b) The taxpayers adjusted basis for determining gain or loss may not be further decreased by any tax credits allowed under this section. (10) For a taxpayer to receive a credit under this section, the agriculture workforce housing must: (a) Comply with all occupational safety or health laws, rules, regulations and standards; (b) If registration is required, be registered as a farmworker camp with the Department of Consumer and Business Services under ORS 658.750; (c) Upon occupancy and if an indorsement is required, be operated by a person who holds a valid indorsement as a farmworker camp operator under ORS 658.730; and (d) Continue to be operated as agriculture workforce housing for a period of at least 10 years after the completion of the agriculture workforce housing project, unless a waiver has been granted under subsection (4) of this section.

(3) In order to qualify for the credit allowed under this section, the taxpayer must obtain written certification from the State Department of Fish and Wildlife as provided in subsection (4) of this section. (4)(a) The State Department of Fish and Wildlife shall issue written certification to taxpayers that are eligible to claim the credit allowed under this section. Before issuing a certification under this subsection, the department must possess evidence that the loss to a taxpayers livestock is due to wolf depredation. The evidence must include a finding by the department or by a peace officer, as defined in ORS 161.015, that wolf depredation was the probable cause of the loss. (b) The department may not issue certifications for more than $37,500 in tax credits for any tax year. The department shall issue certifications to taxpayers in the order in which completed applications for certification are received by the department. (5) A credit allowed under this section shall be reduced by any amount that a taxpayer has already received as compensation for the killed livestock, including compensation pursuant to ORS 610.150. (6) A taxpayer may not claim a credit under this section for: (a) Any tax year that ends after the date on which the State Fish and Wildlife Commission has, by rule, removed the wolf from the list of endangered species established pursuant to ORS 496.172 (2); or (b) A loss to livestock killed after June 30, 2018. (7) If the amount allowable as a credit under this section, when added to the sum of the amounts allowable as payment of tax under ORS 316.187 (withholding), ORS 316.583 (estimated tax), other tax prepayment amounts and other refundable credit amounts, exceeds the taxes imposed by ORS chapters 314 and 316 for the tax year (reduced by any nonrefundable credits allowable for purposes of ORS chapter 316 for the tax year), the amount of the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer as provided in ORS 316.502. (8) The credit shall be claimed on a form prescribed by the Department of Revenue that contains the information required by the department. (9) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular tax year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayers tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise any credit not used in that second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year, but may not be carried forward for any tax year thereafter. (10) In the case of a credit allowed under this section: (a) A nonresident shall be allowed the credit in the proportion provided in ORS 316.117. (b) If a change in the status of the taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117. (c) If a change in the taxable year of the taxpayer occurs as described in ORS 314.085, or if the department terminates the taxpayers taxable year under ORS 314.440, the credit shall be prorated or computed in a manner consistent with ORS 314.085.

      "text": "Dependent care facilities. (1) A credit against the taxes otherwise due under ORS chapter 316 (or, if the taxpayer is a corporation that is an employer, under ORS chapter 317 or 318) is allowed to an employer, based upon costs actually paid or incurred by the employer, to acquire, construct, reconstruct, renovate or otherwise improve real property so that the property may be used primarily as a dependent care facility. (2) The credit allowed under this section shall be the least of: (a) $2,500 multiplied by the number of full-time equivalent employees employed by the employer (on the property or within such proximity to the property that any dependents of the employees may be cared for in the facility) on any date within the two years immediately preceding the end of the first tax year for which credit is first claimed; (b) Fifty percent of the cost of the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, renovation or other improvement; or (c) $100,000. (3) To qualify for the credit allowed under subsection (1) of this section: (a) The amounts paid or incurred by the employer for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, renovation or other improvement to real property may be paid or incurred either: (A) To another to be used to acquire, construct, reconstruct, renovate or otherwise improve real property to the end that it may be used as a dependent care facility with which the employer contracts to make dependent care assistance payments which payments are wholly or partially entitled to exclusion from income of the employee for federal tax purposes under section 129 of the Internal Revenue Code; or (B) To acquire, construct, reconstruct, renovate or otherwise improve real property to the end that it may be operated by the employer, or a combination of employers, to provide dependent care assistance to the employees of the employer under a program or programs under which the assistance is, under section 129 of the Internal Revenue Code, wholly or partially excluded from the income of the employee. (b) The property must be in actual use as a dependent care facility on the last day of the tax year for which credit is claimed and dependent care services assisted by the employer must take place on the acquired, constructed, reconstructed, renovated or improved property and must be entitled to an exclusion (whole or partial) from the income of the employee for federal tax purposes under section 129 of the Internal Revenue Code on the last day of the tax year for which credit is claimed. (c) The person or persons operating the dependent care facility on the property acquired, constructed, reconstructed, renovated or improved must hold a certification (temporary or not) issued under ORS 329A.250 to 329A.450 by the Department of Early Learning and Care to operate the facility on the property on the last day of the tax year of any tax year in which credit under this section is claimed. (d) The dependent care facility acquired, constructed, reconstructed, renovated or otherwise improved must be located in Oregon. No credit shall be allowed under this section if the dependent care facility is not acquired, constructed, reconstructed, renovated or improved to accommodate six or more children. (e) The employer must meet any other requirements or furnish any information, including information furnished by the employees or person operating the dependent care facility, to the Department of Revenue that the department requires under its rules to carry out the purposes of this section. (f) The dependent care facility, the costs of the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, renovation or improvement upon which the credit granted under this section is based, must be placed in operation before January 1, 2002. (4) The total amount of the costs upon which the credit allowable under this section is based, and the total amount of the credit, shall be determined by the employer, subject to any rules adopted by the Department of Revenue, during the tax year in which the property acquired, constructed, reconstructed, renovated or otherwise improved is first placed in operation as a dependent care facility certified by the Department of Early Learning and Care under ORS 329A.250 to 329A.450. One-tenth of the total credit is allowable in that tax year and one-tenth of the total credit is allowable in each succeeding tax year, not to exceed nine tax years, thereafter. No credit shall be allowed under this section for any tax year at the end of which the dependent care facility is not in actual operation under a current certification (temporary or not) issued by the Department of Early Learning and Care nor shall any credit be allowed for any tax year at the end of which the employer is not providing dependent care assistance entitled to exclusion (whole or partial) from employee income for federal tax purposes under section 129 of the Internal Revenue Code for dependent care on the property. Any tax credit allowable under this section in a tax year may be carried forward in the same manner and to the same tax years as if it were a tax credit described in ORS 315.204. (5) Nothing in this section shall affect the computation of depreciation or basis of a dependent care facility. If a deduction is allowed for purposes of ORS chapter 316, 317 or 318 for the amounts paid or incurred upon which the credit under this section is based, the deduction shall be reduced by the dollar amount of the credit granted under this section. (6) For purposes of the credit allowed under this section: (a) The definitions and special rules contained in section 129(e) of the Internal Revenue Code shall apply to the extent applicable. (b) Employer means a resident, part-year resident or full-year nonresident employer carrying on a business, trade, occupation or profession in this state. (7) The Department of Revenue shall require that evidence that the person operating the dependent care facility on the date that the taxpayers tax year ends holds a current certification (temporary or otherwise) to operate the facility accompany the tax return on which any amount of tax credit granted under this section is claimed, or that such evidence be separately furnished. If the evidence is not so furnished, no credit shall be allowed for the tax year for which the evidence is not furnished. The Department of Early Learning and Care shall cooperate by making such evidence, in an appropriate form, available to the person operating the facility, if the person is currently certified (temporary or not) so that, if necessary, it may be made available to the taxpayer.",

(c) Disability means a physical or cognitive condition that results in a person requiring assistance with activities of daily living. (d) Earned income has the meaning given that term in section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code. (e) Qualified taxpayer means a taxpayer: (A) Who is an Oregon resident with at least $6,000 of earned income for the tax year or who is a nonresident of Oregon with at least $6,000 of earned income from Oregon sources for the tax year; (B) With federal adjusted gross income for the tax year that does not exceed 250 percent of the federal poverty level; (C) With Oregon adjusted gross income for the tax year that does not exceed 250 percent of the federal poverty level; and (D) Who does not have more than the maximum amount of disqualified income under section 32(i) of the Internal Revenue Code that is allowed to a taxpayer entitled to the earned income tax credit for federal tax purposes. (f) Qualifying child has the meaning given that term in section 152(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, determined without regard to section 152(c)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code or section 152(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, except that it is limited to an individual who is under 13 years of age, or who is a child with a disability, as that term is defined in ORS 316.099. (2) A taxpayer is not disqualified from claiming the credit under this section solely because the taxpayers spouse has a disability, if the disability is such that it prevents the taxpayers spouse from providing child care, being gainfully employed, seeking employment and attending school. The Department of Revenue may require that a physician verify the existence of the disability and its severity. (3) A qualified taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the taxes otherwise due under ORS chapter 316 equal to the applicable percentage of the qualified taxpayers child care expenses (rounded to the nearest $50). (4) The applicable percentage to be used in calculating the amount of the credit provided in this section shall be determined in accordance with the following table: ______________________________________________________________________________ Applicable Greater of Oregon Percentage Adjusted Gross Income or Federal Adjusted Gross Income, as Percent of Federal Poverty Level 40 200 or less 36 Greater than 200 and less than or equal to 210 32 Greater than 210 and less than or equal to 220 24 Greater than 220 and less than or equal to 230 16 Greater than 230 and less than or equal to 240 8 Greater than 240 and less than or equal to 250 0 Greater than 250 percent of federal poverty level ______________________________________________________________________________ (5) The department may: (a) Adopt rules for carrying out the provisions of this section; and (b) Prescribe the form used to claim a credit and the information required on the form. The form may provide for verification of an individuals disability by a physician, if applicable, as described in subsection (2) of this section. (6) In the case of a credit allowed under this section: (a) A nonresident shall be allowed the credit under this section in the proportion provided in ORS 316.117. (b) If a change in the status of a taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit allowed by this section shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117. (c) If a change in the taxable year of a taxpayer occurs as described in ORS 314.085, or if the Department of Revenue terminates the taxpayers taxable year under ORS 314.440, the credit allowed under this section shall be prorated or computed in a manner consistent with ORS 314.085. (d) In the case of a qualified taxpayer who is married, a credit shall be allowed under this section only if: (A) The taxpayer files a joint return; (B) The taxpayer files a separate return and is legally separated or subject to a separate maintenance agreement; or (C) The taxpayer files a separate return and the taxpayer and the taxpayers spouse reside in separate households on the last day of the tax year with the intent of remaining in separate households in the future. (7) If the amount allowable as a credit under this section, when added to the sum of the amounts allowable as payment of tax under ORS 316.187 (withholding), ORS 316.583 (estimated tax), other tax prepayment amounts and other refundable credit amounts, exceeds the taxes imposed by ORS chapters 314 and 316 for the tax year (reduced by any nonrefundable credits allowable for purposes of ORS chapter 316 for the tax year), the amount of the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer as provided in ORS 316.502. (8)(a) The minimum amount of earned income a taxpayer must earn in order to be a qualified taxpayer shall be adjusted for tax years beginning in each calendar year by multiplying $6,000 by the ratio of the monthly averaged U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for the 12 consecutive months ending August 31 of the prior calendar year over the monthly averaged index for the second quarter of the calendar year 1998. (b) As used in this subsection, U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index means the U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (All Items) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. (c) If any adjustment determined under paragraph (a) of this subsection is not a multiple of $50, the adjustment shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. (d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subsection, the adjusted minimum amount of earned income a taxpayer must earn may not exceed the amount an individual would earn if the individual worked 1,040 hours at the minimum wage established under ORS 653.025 and in effect on January 1 of the calendar year in which begins the tax year of the taxpayer, rounded to the next lower multiple of $50.

(1)(a) A credit against the tax otherwise due under ORS chapter 316 shall be allowed a taxpayer in an amount equal to a percentage of employment-related expenses of a type allowable as a credit pursuant to section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code, notwithstanding the limitation imposed by section 21(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, and limited as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection. (b) The credit allowed under this section may be claimed for expenses for care of a qualifying individual that allow a nonmarried taxpayer to seek employment or to attend school as a degree-seeking student enrolled on a full-time or part-time basis. (c) The employment-related expenses for which a credit is claimed under this section may not exceed the least of: (A) The combination of earned income taxable by Oregon and reportable on the taxpayers return and imputed income; (B) The lesser amount, attributable to either spouse, of the combination of the spouses imputed income and the spouses earned income subject to taxation by Oregon, if reportable on a joint return; or (C) $12,000 for a taxpayer for which there is one qualifying individual, or $24,000 for a taxpayer for which there are two or more qualifying individuals. (d) The limitations in paragraph (c)(C) of this subsection shall be reduced by the aggregate amount excludable under section 129 of the Internal Revenue Code for the tax year. (2) The applicable percentage described in subsection (1) of this section shall be determined in accordance with the following table: ______________________________________________________________________________ Greater of Federal or Oregon Adjusted Gross Income, as Applicable percentage based on age of youngest Percentage of Federal qualifying individual on January 1 of tax year Poverty Level ______________________________________________________________________________ At least 6 years but less than At least 13, or at least 3 years 13 but less 18 years or Greater Less than Under 3 but less than 18 if older if than or equal to years than 6 disabled disabled 0% 10% 10% 8% 5% 5% 10% 20% 20% 18% 15% 5% 20% 30% 30% 28% 25% 10% 30% 40% 40% 38% 35% 20% 40% 50% 50% 48% 45% 30% 50% 60% 55% 53% 50% 35% 60% 70% 60% 58% 55% 40% 70% 80% 65% 63% 60% 45% 80% 90% 70% 68% 65% 50% 90% 110% 75% 73% 70% 55% 110% 120% 71% 69% 66% 50% 120% 130% 66% 64% 61% 45% 130% 140% 61% 59% 56% 39% 140% 150% 55% 53% 50% 33% 150% 160% 50% 48% 45% 28% 160% 200% 47% 45% 42% 25% 200% 210% 45% 43% 40% 22% 210% 220% 40% 38% 35% 20% 220% 230% 35% 33% 30% 15% 230% 240% 30% 28% 25% 10% 240% 250% 20% 18% 15% 5% 250% 260% 10% 8% 5% 5% 260% 280% 6% 6% 4% 4% 280% 300% 4% 4% 4% 4% 300% - 0% 0% 0% 0% ______________________________________________________________________________ (3) The applicable percentage for a household in excess of eight members shall be calculated as if for a household size of eight members. (4) The credit under this section is not allowed to a taxpayer with federal adjusted gross income or Oregon adjusted gross income, whichever is greater, in excess of 300 percent of the federal poverty level. (5) For the purposes of calculating the allowed amount of credit applicable to a student: (a) Imputed income shall equal $1,000 per qualified month per student for a student for whom there is one qualifying individual, or $2,000 per qualified month per student for a student for which there are two or more qualifying individuals. (b) A qualified month is any month in which the student is a full-time or part-time student and attending school, or a summer month in a calendar year in which the student was enrolled in a degree-seeking program in both the spring and fall academic terms. (c) The school ratio shall equal 100 percent for a month for which a student is qualified for student financial aid as a full-time student, and 70 percent for a month for which a student is qualified for student financial aid as a part-time student. (d) If a student is a part-time student for a portion of the year and a full-time student for the balance of the year, the credit shall be prorated. The school ratio applicable to the summer months, if any, shall be the school ratio applicable to the immediately preceding spring month. (6) Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3) of this section, for a student with adjusted gross income as a percentage of the federal poverty level that is less than or equal to 110 percent, the amount of credit shall be the greater of: (a) The credit calculated using subsection (2) of this section; or (b) The product of the applicable percentage, as shown in subsection (2) of this section, corresponding to an adjusted gross income percentage of 110 percent, multiplied by: (A) The lesser of expenses for care of a qualifying individual or imputed income; and (B) The school ratio. (7) In order to ensure compliance with the eligibility requirements of the credit allowed under this section, the Department of Revenue shall be afforded access to utilization data maintained by the Department of Early Learning and Care in its administration of the Employment Related Day Care subsidy program. (8) The Department of Revenue may assess a penalty in an amount not to exceed 25 percent of the amount of credit claimed by the taxpayer against any taxpayer who knowingly claims or attempts to claim any amount of credit under this section for which the taxpayer is ineligible, or against any individual who knowingly assists another individual in claiming any amount of credit for which the individual is ineligible. (9) The Department of Revenue may adopt rules for carrying out the provisions of this section and prescribe the form used to claim a credit and the information required on the form. (10) A nonresident individual shall be allowed the credit computed in the same manner and subject to the same limitations as the credit allowed a resident by subsection (1) of this section. However, the credit shall be prorated using the proportion provided in ORS 316.117. (11) If a change in the taxable year of a taxpayer occurs as described in ORS 314.085, or if the Department of Revenue terminates the taxpayers taxable year under ORS 314.440, the credit allowed by this section shall be prorated or computed in a manner consistent with ORS 314.085. (12) If a change in the status of a taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit allowed by this section shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117. (13) If the amount allowable as a credit under this section, when added to the sum of the amounts allowable as payment of tax under ORS 316.187 or 316.583, other tax prepayment amounts and other refundable credit amounts, exceeds the taxes imposed by ORS chapters 314 and 316 for the tax year after application of any nonrefundable credits allowable for purposes of ORS chapter 316 for the tax year, the amount of the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer as provided in ORS 316.502. (14) Any amount that is refunded to the taxpayer under this section and that is in excess of the tax liability of the taxpayer does not bear interest.

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, for a taxpayer with a dependent under the age of three at the close of the tax year, the credit allowed under this section shall be in an amount equal to 12 percent of the earned income credit allowable to the individual for the same tax year under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code. (2) A resident individual may claim a credit under this section, using either a Social Security number or an individual taxpayer identification number, if, but for section 32(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the individual would otherwise be eligible to claim a credit under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code. The credit allowed as provided in this subsection shall equal the percentage, as stated in subsection (1) of this section, of the amount that would be allowed on a federal return, based on the amount of the individuals earned income and the other provisions of section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code.

(5) If a change in the status of a taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit allowed by this section shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117. (6) If the amount allowable as a credit under this section, when added to the sum of the amounts allowable as payment of tax under ORS 316.187 or 316.583, other tax prepayment amounts and other refundable credit amounts, exceeds the taxes imposed by ORS chapters 314 and 316 for the tax year after application of any nonrefundable credits allowable for purposes of ORS chapter 316 for the tax year, the amount of the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer as provided in ORS 316.502.

      "text": "Qualifying child of taxpayer. (1) As used in this section: (a) Dependent means an individual who is under the age of six years at the close of the tax year and who is a dependent of a taxpayer as described in section 152(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, determined without regard to section 152(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. (b) Qualifying child has the meaning given that term in section 152(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. (c) Qualifying income limit means: (A) For a taxpayer other than a taxpayer described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, adjusted gross income, as defined in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code, as modified using Oregon subtractions and additions, but with losses of a taxpayer added back, to the extent that those losses exceed $20,000; or (B) For a nonresident or part-year resident, the greater of the amount determined under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, or adjusted gross income, as defined in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code. (2) A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the tax otherwise due under ORS chapter 316 for the tax year, with an amount allowed for each dependent of the taxpayer who is a qualifying child with respect to the taxpayer, not to exceed five properly claimed dependents per tax return. The credit shall be allowed as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section. A taxpayer may claim a credit under this section using an individual taxpayer identification number and may claim it for dependents using individual taxpayer identification numbers. (3) The credit under this section: (a) Shall be in an amount of $1,000 per dependent of the taxpayer, but, if the taxpayer has a qualifying income limit in excess of $25,000, regardless of the type of income tax return filed by the taxpayer, the total amount of the credit shall be reduced as provided in subsection (4) of this section. (b) May not be claimed if the percentage calculated in subsection (4) of this section is greater than or equal to 100 percent. (c) May not be claimed by a married taxpayer who files a separate return. (4) If a reduction under subsection (3) of this section is required, the amount by which the credit shall be reduced is computed by multiplying the amount otherwise available under subsection (3) of this section by a percentage. The percentage is computed by dividing, by 5,000, the amount by which the taxpayers qualifying income limit exceeds $25,000. (5)(a) For tax years beginning in each calendar year, the Department of Revenue shall adjust the dollar amounts of the credit and of the income threshold set forth in subsections (3) and (4) of this section by multiplying each dollar amount by the cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year. (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection, the cost-of-living adjustment for any calendar year is the percentage (if any) by which the monthly averaged U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for the 12 consecutive months ending August 31 of the prior calendar year exceeds the monthly averaged index for the second quarter of the calendar year 2022. (c) As used in this subsection, U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index means the U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (All Items) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. (d) If any increase determined under paragraph (a) of this subsection is not a multiple of $50, the increase shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $50. (6)(a) If the amount allowable as a credit under this section, when added to the sum of the amounts allowable as payment of tax under ORS 316.187 or 316.583, other tax prepayment amounts and other refundable credit amounts, exceeds the taxes imposed by ORS chapters 314 and 316 for the tax year after application of any nonrefundable credits allowable for purposes of ORS chapter 316 for the tax year, the amount of the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer as provided in ORS 316.502. (b) The credit under this section shall be computed after the allowance of any other credit or offset against tax liability. (7) A nonresident or part-year resident shall be allowed the credit under this section in the same manner and, aside from the taxpayers applicable qualifying income limit, subject to the same limitations as a resident. However, the credit shall be prorated using the proportion provided in ORS 316.117. (8) If a change in the tax year of a taxpayer occurs as described in ORS 314.085, or if the Department of Revenue terminates the taxpayers tax year under ORS 314.440, the credit allowed by this section shall be prorated or computed in a manner consistent with ORS 314.085. (9) If a change in the status of a taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit allowed by this section shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117. (10) Refunds attributable to the child tax credit allowed under this section do not bear interest.",

The amount of the credit allowed under this section may not exceed: (a) For housing owned by the taxpayer for at least five years, 2.5 percent of the lesser of the housings sale price or the appraisal under ORS 315.286 (2)(e); or (b) For housing owned by the taxpayer for at least 10 years, five percent of the lesser of the housings sale price or the appraisal under ORS 315.286 (2)(e). (2) In order to claim a credit under this section, a taxpayer must: (a) Lack identity of interest with the purchaser; and (b) Receive certification of a credit under ORS 315.286 (6) and submit the certification to the Department of Revenue upon request of the department. (3) The Department of Revenue may: (a) Adopt rules for carrying out the provisions of this section; and (b) Prescribe the form used to claim a credit under this section and the information required on the form. (4) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular tax year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayers tax liability for the next succeeding tax year.

(b) If a change in the status of a taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit allowed by this section must be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117.

      "text": "Pollution control facilities. (1) A credit against taxes imposed by ORS chapter 316 (or, if the taxpayer is a corporation, under ORS chapter 317 or 318) for a pollution control facility or facilities certified under ORS 468.170 shall be allowed if the taxpayer qualifies under subsection (4) of this section. (2) For a facility certified under ORS 468.170, the maximum credit allowed in any one tax year shall be the lesser of the tax liability of the taxpayer or the applicable percentage of the certified cost of the facility, as determined under ORS 468.173 or 468.183, multiplied by the certified percentage allocable to pollution control, divided by the number of years of the facilitys useful life. The number of years of the facilitys useful life used in this calculation shall be the remaining number of years of useful life at the time the facility is certified but not less than one year nor more than 10 years. (3) To qualify for the credit the pollution control facility must be erected, constructed or installed in accordance with the provisions of ORS 468.165 (1) and must be certified for tax relief under ORS 468.155 to 468.190. (4) To qualify for a tax credit under this section: (a) The taxpayer who is allowed the credit must be: (A) The owner, including a contract purchaser, of the trade or business that utilizes Oregon property requiring a pollution control facility to prevent or minimize pollution; (B) A person who, as a lessee or pursuant to an agreement, conducts the trade or business that operates or utilizes such property; or (C) A person who, as an owner, including a contract purchaser, or lessee, owns or leases a pollution control facility that is used: (i) In a business that is engaged in a production activity described in 40 C.F.R. 430.20 (as of July 1, 1998); or (ii) For recycling, material recovery or energy recovery as defined in ORS 459.005; and (b) The facility must be owned or leased during the tax year by the taxpayer claiming the credit and must have been in use and operation during the tax year for which the credit is claimed. (5) Regardless of when the facility is erected, constructed or installed, a credit under this section may be claimed by a taxpayer: (a) For a facility qualifying under ORS 468.165 (1)(a) or (b), only in those tax years which begin on or after January 1, 1967. (b) For a facility qualifying under ORS 468.165 (1)(c), in those tax years which begin on or after January 1, 1973. (c) For a facility qualifying under ORS 468.165 (1)(d), in those tax years which begin on or after January 1, 1984. (6) For a facility certified under ORS 468.170, the maximum total credit allowable shall not exceed one-half of the certified cost of the facility multiplied by the certified percentage allocable to pollution control. (7) The credit provided by this section is not in lieu of any depreciation or amortization deduction for the facility to which the taxpayer otherwise may be entitled under ORS chapter 316, 317 or 318 for such year. (8) Upon any sale, exchange or other disposition of a facility, notice thereof shall be given to the Environmental Quality Commission who shall revoke the certification covering such facility as of the date of such disposition. Notwithstanding ORS 468.170 (4)(c), the transferee may apply for a new certificate under ORS 468.170, but the tax credit available to such transferee shall be limited to the amount of credit not claimed by the transferor. The sale, exchange or other disposition of shares in an S corporation as defined in section 1361 of the Internal Revenue Code or of a partners interest in a partnership shall not be deemed a sale, exchange or other disposition of a facility for purposes of this subsection. (9) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section which is not used by the taxpayer in a particular year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayers tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in such next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year, but may not be carried forward for any tax year thereafter. Credits may be carried forward to and used in a tax year beyond the years specified in ORS 468.170. (10) The taxpayers adjusted basis for determining gain or loss shall not be further decreased by any tax credits allowed under this section. (11) A person described in subsection (4)(a)(C) of this section may, but need not, operate the facility or conduct a trade or business that utilizes property requiring the facility. If more than one person has an interest under subsection (4)(a)(C) of this section in the facility, only one person may claim the credit allowed under this section. However, portions of the facility may be certified separately in the same manner as provided in ORS 468.170 (8) if ownership of the portions is in more than one person. The person claiming the credit as between an owner, including a contract purchaser, and lessee under this subsection shall be designated in a written statement signed by both the lessor and lessee of the facility. This statement shall be filed with the Department of Revenue not later than the final day of the first tax year for which a tax credit is claimed. (12)(a) A taxpayer may not be allowed a tax credit under this section for any tax year during which the taxpayer is convicted of a felony under ORS 468.922 to 468.956 that is related to the facility for which the tax credit would otherwise be claimed, or for the four tax years succeeding the tax year during which the taxpayer is convicted. (b) The amount of any tax credit that is otherwise allowable under this section but for paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be considered to be claimed by the taxpayer for purposes of determining the amount of tax credit that may be claimed in a tax year in which paragraph (a) of this subsection permits the taxpayer to claim the credit.

(1) Notwithstanding ORS 315.304 (9), in the case of a pollution control facility for which unexpired tax credits exist as of the tax year of the taxpayer that begins in the 2001 calendar year, if the facility is in use and operation during the tax year immediately following the third succeeding tax year described in ORS 315.304 (9), any credit under ORS 315.304 remaining unused may be carried forward to that fourth succeeding tax year. If the facility is in use and operation during the tax year immediately following the fourth succeeding tax year, any credit under ORS 315.304 remaining unused may be carried forward to that fifth succeeding tax year. If the facility is in use and operation during the tax year immediately following the fifth succeeding tax year, any credit under ORS 315.304 remaining unused may be carried forward to that sixth succeeding tax year, but may not be carried forward to any tax year thereafter. (2) For purposes of this section, unexpired tax credits include credits claimed pursuant to ORS 315.304 (2) and credits carried over from previous tax years pursuant to ORS 315.304 (9).",

(1) A credit against the taxes that are otherwise due under ORS chapter 316 or, if the taxpayer is a corporation, under ORS chapter 317 or 318, is allowed to a taxpayer for certified renewable energy development contributions made by the taxpayer during the tax year to the Renewable Energy Development Subaccount, established in ORS 470.805, of the Clean Energy Deployment Fund established in ORS 470.800. (2)(a) The Department of Revenue shall, in cooperation with the State Department of Energy, conduct an auction of tax credits under this section. The auction may be conducted no later than April 15 following December 31 of any tax year for which the credit is allowed. The department may conduct the auction in the manner that it determines is best suited to maximize the return to the state on the sale of tax credit certifications and shall announce a reserve bid prior to conducting the auction. The reserve amount shall be at least 95 percent of the total amount of the tax credit. Moneys necessary to reimburse the Department of Revenue for the actual costs incurred by the department in administering an auction, not to exceed 0.25 percent of auction proceeds, are continuously appropriated to the department. The Department of Revenue shall deposit net receipts from the auction required under this section in the Renewable Energy Development Subaccount, established in ORS 470.805, of the Clean Energy Deployment Fund established in ORS 470.800. Net receipts from the auction required under this section shall be used only for purposes related to renewable energy development. (b) The State Department of Energy shall adopt rules in order to achieve the following goals: (A) Subject to paragraph (a) of this subsection, generate contributions for which tax credits of $1.5 million are certified for each fiscal year; (B) Maximize income and excise tax revenues that are retained by the State of Oregon for state operations; and (C) Provide the necessary financial incentives for taxpayers to make contributions, taking into consideration the impact of granting a credit upon a taxpayers federal income tax liability. (3) Contributions made under this section shall be deposited in the Renewable Energy Development Subaccount, established in ORS 470.805, of the Clean Energy Deployment Fund established in ORS 470.800. (4)(a) Upon receipt of a contribution, the State Department of Energy shall, except as provided in ORS 315.329, issue to the taxpayer written certification of the amount certified for tax credit under this section to the extent the amount certified for tax credit, when added to all amounts previously certified for tax credit under this section, does not exceed $1.5 million for the fiscal year in which certification is made. (b) The State Department of Energy and the Department of Revenue are not liable, and a refund of a contributed amount need not be made, if a taxpayer who has received tax credit certification is unable to use all or a portion of the tax credit to offset the tax liability of the taxpayer. (5) The tax credit allowed under this section for any one tax year may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer. (6) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular tax year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayers tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year but may not be carried forward for any tax year thereafter. (7) If a tax credit is claimed under this section by a nonresident or part-year resident taxpayer, the amount shall be allowed without proration under ORS 316.117. (8) If the amount of contribution for which a tax credit certification is made is allowed as a deduction for federal tax purposes, the amount of the contribution shall be added to federal taxable income for Oregon tax purposes.

(1) A credit is allowed against the taxes otherwise due under ORS chapter 316 or, if the taxpayer is a corporation, under ORS chapter 317 or 318, for an energy conservation project that is certified under ORS 469B.270 to 469B.306. The credit is allowed as follows: (a) Except as provided in ORS 469B.298 and in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the credit allowed in each of the first two tax years in which the credit is claimed shall be 10 percent of the certified cost of the facility, but may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer. The credit allowed in each of the succeeding three years shall be five percent of the certified cost, but may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer. (b) If the certified cost of the facility does not exceed $20,000, the total amount of the credit allowable under subsection (3) of this section may be claimed in the first tax year for which the credit may be claimed, but may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer. (2) In order for a tax credit to be allowable under this section: (a) The project must be located in Oregon. (b) The project must have received final certification from the Director of the State Department of Energy under ORS 469B.270 to 469B.306. (c) If the project is a research and development project, it must receive, prior to certification under ORS 469B.288, a recommendation from a qualified third party selected by the director. (d) If the project is new construction or a total building retrofit, then the project must achieve, at a minimum, the energy efficiency standards required for: (A) LEED Platinum certification; (B) A four globes rating from the Green Globes program; (C) A nationally or regionally recognized and appropriate sustainable building program whose performance standards are equivalent to the standards required for LEED Platinum certification or a four globes rating from the Green Globes program, as determined by the department; or (D) Verification that the construction conformed to the standards of the Reach Code adopted pursuant to ORS 455.500. (3) The total amount of credit allowable to an eligible taxpayer under this section may not exceed 35 percent of the certified cost of the project. (4)(a) Upon any sale, termination of the lease or contract, exchange or other disposition of the project, notice thereof shall be given to the director, who shall revoke the certificate covering the project as of the date of such disposition. (b) A new owner, or, upon re-leasing of the project, a new lessee, may apply for a new certificate under ORS 469B.291. The new lessee or owner must meet the requirements of ORS 469B.270 to 469B.306 and may claim a tax credit under this section only if all moneys owed by the new owner or lessee to the State of Oregon have been paid, if the project continues to operate and if all conditions in the final certification are met. The tax credit available to the new owner shall be limited to the amount of credit not claimed by the former owner or, for a new lessee, the amount of credit not claimed by the lessee under all previous leases. The State Department of Energy may waive the requirement that a new owner or lessee apply for a new certificate under ORS 469B.291 if the remaining credit is less than $20,000. (c) The department may not revoke the certificate covering a project under paragraph (a) of this subsection if the tax credit associated with the project has been transferred to a taxpayer who is an eligible applicant under ORS 469B.285. (5) The tax credit allowed under this section for any one tax year may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer. (6) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayers tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in that next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that third succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fourth succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that fourth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fifth succeeding tax year, but may not be carried forward for any tax year thereafter. Credits may be carried forward to and used in a tax year beyond the years specified in subsection (1) of this section only as provided in this subsection. (7) The credit allowed under this section is not in lieu of any depreciation or amortization deduction for the project to which the taxpayer otherwise may be entitled for purposes of ORS chapter 316, 317 or 318 for such year. (8) The taxpayers adjusted basis for determining gain or loss may not be decreased by any tax credits allowed under this section. (9) The definitions in ORS 469B.270 apply to this section.

The new lessor or owner must meet the requirements of ORS 469B.130 to 469B.169 and may claim a tax credit under this section only if all moneys owed to the State of Oregon have been paid, the facility continues to operate, unless continued operation is waived by the State Department of Energy, and all conditions in the final certification are met. The tax credit available to the new owner shall be limited to the amount of credit not claimed by the former owner or, for a new lessor, the amount of credit not claimed by the lessor under all previous leases. (c) The State Department of Energy may not revoke the certificate covering a facility under paragraph (a) of this subsection if the tax credit associated with the facility has been transferred to a taxpayer who is an eligible applicant under ORS 469B.145 (1)(c)(A). (6) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayers tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in that next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that third succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fourth succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that fourth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fifth succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that fifth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the sixth succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that sixth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the seventh succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that seventh succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the eighth succeeding tax year, but may not be carried forward for any tax year thereafter. Credits may be carried forward to and used in a tax year beyond the years specified in subsection (1) of this section only as provided in this subsection. (7) The credit provided by this section is not in lieu of any depreciation or amortization deduction for the facility to which the taxpayer otherwise may be entitled for purposes of ORS chapter 316, 317 or 318 for such year. (8) The taxpayers adjusted basis for determining gain or loss may not be decreased by any tax credits allowed under this section. (9) If a homebuilder claims a credit under this section with respect to a homebuilder-installed renewable energy system or a high-performance home: (a) The homebuilder may not claim credits for both a homebuilder-installed renewable energy system and a high-performance home with respect to the same dwelling; (b) The homebuilder must inform the buyer of the dwelling that the homebuilder is claiming a tax credit under this section with respect to the dwelling; and (c) The buyer of the dwelling may not claim a credit under this section that is based on any facility for which the homebuilder has already claimed a credit. (10) The definitions in ORS 469B.130 apply to this section.",

(d) Bone dry ton means matter that is dried to less than one percent moisture content and that weighs 2,000 pounds. (e) Fuel blend means diesel fuel of blends equal to or exceeding 99 percent biodiesel or gasoline of a blend equal to or exceeding 85 percent methanol or ethanol. (2)(a) A resident individual shall be allowed a credit against the taxes otherwise due under ORS chapter 316 for costs paid or incurred to purchase fuel blends for use in an alternative fuel vehicle. (b) A resident individual shall be allowed a credit against the taxes otherwise due under ORS chapter 316 for costs paid or incurred to purchase forest, rangeland or agriculture waste or residue densified and dried prepared solid biofuel that contains 100 percent biomass. (3) The amount of the credit shall be calculated as follows: (a) Determine the quantity of fuel blend or solid biofuel purchased by the taxpayer during the tax year; (b) Categorize the fuel blend or solid biofuel as prescribed in rules adopted under ORS 469B.400; and (c) Multiply the quantity of fuel blend or solid biofuel in a particular category by the appropriate credit rate for that category, expressed in dollars and cents. (4) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section: (a) The credit allowed under this section for diesel blended fuel is equal to $0.50 per gallon and in any one tax year may not exceed $200 per Oregon registered motor vehicle that is owned or leased by the taxpayer under a lease of greater than 30 days duration and that is capable of using a fuel blend. (b) The credit allowed for gasoline blended fuel is equal to $0.50 per gallon and in any one tax year may not exceed $200 per Oregon registered motor vehicle that is owned or leased by the taxpayer under a lease of greater than 30 days duration and that is capable of using a fuel blend. (c) The credit allowed for forest, rangeland or agriculture waste or residue densified and dried prepared solid biofuel is equal to $10 per bone dry ton of solid biofuel and in any one tax year may not exceed $200 per taxpayer. (d) The credit allowed in any one tax year may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer and may not be carried forward to a subsequent tax year. (5) For each tax year for which a credit is claimed under this section, the taxpayer shall maintain records sufficient to determine the taxpayers purchase of qualifying fuel blends. A taxpayer shall maintain the records required under this subsection for at least five years. (6) A nonresident shall be allowed the credit under this section in the proportion provided in ORS 316.117. (7) If a change in the taxable year of a taxpayer occurs as described in ORS 314.085, or if the Department of Revenue terminates the taxpayers taxable year under ORS 314.440, the credit allowed by this section shall be prorated or computed in a manner consistent with ORS 314.085. (8) If a change in the status of a taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit allowed by this section shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117. (9) Spouses in a marriage who file separate returns for a taxable year may each claim a share of the tax credit that would have been allowed on a joint return in proportion to the contribution of each.

(2) The amount of the credit allowed to the eligible business shall equal: (a) The amount of tribal property tax imposed on a new business facility of an eligible business that is paid or incurred by the eligible business during the income or corporate excise tax year of the eligible business; or (b) If the eligible business has not previously conducted business operations within the reservation enterprise zone or reservation partnership zone, the amount of tribal tax paid or incurred by the eligible business during the income or corporate excise tax year of the eligible business. (3) The credit allowed to the eligible business may not exceed the tax liability of the eligible business for the tax year and may not be carried over to another tax year. (4) A credit is allowable under this section only to the extent the tribal tax on which the credit is based is imposed on businesses not owned by Indians on a uniform basis within the territory over which the tribal government has the authority to levy, impose and collect taxes. (5) The credit shall be claimed on a form prescribed by the Department of Revenue containing the information required by the department, including information sufficient for the department to determine that the taxpayer is an eligible business and that the facility operated by the business is a new business facility.

(9) An eligible business claiming a credit under this section shall maintain records sufficient to authenticate the allowance of the credit claimed under this section and shall furnish the department with these records upon the request of the department.

(2)(a) The Department of Revenue shall, in cooperation with the Oregon Film and Video Office, conduct an auction of tax credits under this section. The auction may be conducted no later than April 15 following December 31 of any tax year for which the credit is allowed. The department may conduct the auction in the manner that it determines is best suited to maximize the return to the state on the sale of tax credit certifications and shall announce a reserve bid prior to conducting the auction. The reserve amount shall be at least 90 percent of the total amount of the tax credit. Moneys necessary to reimburse the department for the actual costs incurred by the department in administering an auction, not to exceed 0.25 percent of auction proceeds, are continuously appropriated to the department. The department shall deposit net receipts from the auction required under this section in the Oregon Production Investment Fund. (b) The Oregon Film and Video Office shall adopt rules in order to achieve the following goals: (A) Subject to paragraph (a) of this subsection, generate contributions for which tax credits of $20 million are certified for each fiscal year; (B) Maximize income and excise tax revenues that are retained by the State of Oregon for state operations; and (C) Provide the necessary financial incentives for taxpayers to make contributions, taking into consideration the impact of granting a credit upon a taxpayers federal income tax liability. (3) Contributions made under this section shall be deposited in the Oregon Production Investment Fund. (4)(a) Upon receipt of a contribution, the Oregon Film and Video Office shall, except as provided in ORS 315.516, issue to the taxpayer written certification of the amount certified for tax credit under this section to the extent the amount certified for tax credit, when added to all amounts previously certified for tax credit under this section, does not exceed $20 million for the fiscal year in which certification is made. (b) The Oregon Film and Video Office may issue a certification for a credit under this section, and a credit may be allowed, for the tax year in which a contribution is made, or for the tax year immediately preceding the tax year in which a contribution is made and for auctions conducted no later than April 15 following December 31 of any tax year for which the credit is allowed, if no return has yet been filed for the preceding tax year. (c) The Oregon Film and Video Office and the department are not liable, and a refund of a contributed amount need not be made, if a taxpayer who has received tax credit certification is unable to use all or a portion of the tax credit to offset the tax liability of the taxpayer. (5) To the extent the Oregon Film and Video Office does not certify contributed amounts as eligible for a tax credit under this section, the taxpayer may request a refund of the amount the taxpayer contributed, and the office shall refund that amount. (6)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, a tax credit claimed under this section may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer and may not be carried over to another tax year. (b) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular tax year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayers tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year but may not be carried forward for any tax year thereafter. (c) A taxpayer is not eligible for a tax credit under this section if the first tax year for which the credit would otherwise be allowed begins on or after January 1, 2030. (7) If a tax credit is claimed under this section by a nonresident or part-year resident taxpayer, the amount shall be allowed without proration under ORS 316.117. (8) If the amount of contribution for which a tax credit certification is made is allowed as a deduction for federal tax purposes, the amount of the contribution shall be added to federal taxable income for Oregon tax purposes.

(2) A credit against taxes that are otherwise due under ORS chapter 316 or, if the taxpayer is a corporation, under ORS chapter 317 or 318, is allowed to a taxpayer who is located in a qualifying county and who establishes and implements an employee training program in collaboration with a local community college operated under ORS chapter 341.

      "text": "Qualified equity investments. (1) As used in this section, applicable percentage means zero percent for each of the first two credit allowance dates, seven percent for the third credit allowance date and eight percent for the next four credit allowance dates. (2) A person that makes a qualified equity investment shall, at the time of investment, earn a vested credit against the taxes otherwise due under ORS chapter 316 or, if the person is a corporation, under ORS chapter 317 or 318. (3)(a) The total amount of the tax credit available to a taxpayer under this section shall equal 39 percent of the purchase price of the qualified equity investment. (b) The taxpayer that holds a qualified equity investment on a particular credit allowance date of the qualified equity investment may claim a portion of the tax credit against its tax liability for the tax year that includes the credit allowance date equal to the applicable percentage for that credit allowance date multiplied by the purchase price of the qualified equity investment. (4) The credit allowed under this section may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer for the tax year in which the credit is claimed. (5) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular tax year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayers tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the third succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fourth succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in the fourth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fifth succeeding tax year, but may not be used in any tax year thereafter. (6) The following conditions must exist for a taxpayer to be eligible for the credit allowed under this section: (a) A qualified community development entity that issues a debt instrument may not make cash interest payments on the debt instrument during the period commencing with its issuance and ending on its final credit allowance date in excess of the sum of the cash interest payments and the cumulative operating income, as defined in the regulations promulgated under section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code, of the qualified community development entity for the same period. Neither this paragraph nor the definition of long-term debt security provided in ORS 315.529 in any way limits the holders ability to accelerate payments on the debt instrument in situations where the qualified community development entity has defaulted on covenants designed to ensure compliance with this section or section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code. (b) A business shall be considered a qualified active low-income community business for the duration of a qualified community development entitys investment in or loan to the business, if it is reasonable to expect that at the time of the qualified community development entitys investment in or loan to a qualified active low-income community business, the business will continue to satisfy the requirements for being a qualified active low-income community business throughout the entire period of the investment or loan. (c) A qualified equity investment must be designated by the issuer as a qualified equity investment and be certified by the Oregon Business Development Department as not exceeding the limitation in ORS 285C.653. The qualified community development entity must keep sufficiently detailed books and records with respect to the investments made with the proceeds of the qualified equity investments to allow the direct tracing of proceeds into qualified low-income community investments in qualified active low-income community businesses in this state. (d) The qualified community development entity shall report annually to the department: (A) The number of employment positions created and retained as a result of qualified low-income community investments by the qualified community development entity; (B) The average annual salary of positions described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; and (C) The number of positions described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph that provide health benefits. (e) The maximum amount of qualified low-income community investments that may be made in a qualified active low-income community business and all of its affiliates, with the proceeds of qualified equity investments that have been certified under ORS 285C.650, shall be $8 million, whether made by one or several qualified community development entities. (f) A qualified equity investment must be made before July 1, 2016. Nothing in this paragraph precludes an entity that makes a qualified equity investment prior to July 1, 2016, from claiming a tax credit relating to that qualified equity investment for each applicable credit allowance date. (7) A taxpayer claiming a credit under this section may not claim any other credit under this chapter or ORS chapter 285C during the same tax year based on activities related to the same qualified active low-income community business.",

(1) A credit against taxes imposed by ORS chapter 316 (or, if the taxpayer is a corporation, under ORS chapter 317 or 318) is allowed to a taxpayer, based upon short line railroad rehabilitation project costs actually paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the tax year for which the credit is claimed. (2) The credit allowed under this section shall be the lesser of: (a) $3,500 multiplied by the number of miles of short line railroad track the taxpayer owns or leases in this state on the day the short line railroad rehabilitation project is completed; or (b) Fifty percent of the short line railroad rehabilitation project costs paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the tax year in which the credit is claimed. (3) For the credit to be allowed under this section: (a) The infrastructure must be located in Oregon; and (b) The taxpayer must: (A) Own or lease the infrastructure; (B) Be a short line railroad; and (C) Receive a final written certification from the Department of Transportation before claiming the credit. (4) A credit under this section is not allowed for: (a) Costs that are funded by or used to qualify for any state or federal grants. (b) The amount that is equal to the greater of: (A) Costs that are used to claim a federal tax credit under section 45G of the Internal Revenue Code; or (B) The credit limitation set out in section 45G(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applied to the taxpayers miles of short line railroad track in this state. (5) The amount of the credit claimed under this section for any one tax year may not exceed the tax liability of the taxpayer. (6) Any tax credit otherwise allowable under this section that is not used by the taxpayer in a particular tax year may be carried forward and offset against the taxpayers tax liability for the next succeeding tax year. Any credit remaining unused in that next succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the second succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that second succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the third succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that third succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fourth succeeding tax year, and likewise, any credit not used in that fourth succeeding tax year may be carried forward and used in the fifth succeeding tax year but may not be carried forward for any tax year thereafter. (7) The credit allowed under this section is not in lieu of any depreciation or amortization deduction for the short line railroad rehabilitation project to which the taxpayer otherwise may be entitled for purposes of ORS chapter 316, 317 or 318 for the tax year. (8) The taxpayers adjusted basis for determining gain or loss may not be decreased by any tax credit allowed under this section. (9) The credit shall be claimed on a form prescribed by the Department of Revenue that contains the information required by the department. (10) In the case of a credit allowed under this section: (a) A nonresident shall be allowed the credit under this section in the proportion provided in ORS 316.117. (b) If a change in the status of a taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit allowed by this section shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117. (c) If a change in the taxable year of a taxpayer occurs as described in ORS 314.085, or if the Department of Revenue terminates a taxpayers taxable year under ORS 314.440, the credit allowed under this section shall be prorated or computed in a manner consistent with ORS 314.085. (11) A person that has earned a tax credit under this section may transfer the credit to a taxpayer subject to tax under ORS chapter 316, 317 or 318. The transfer must comply with ORS 315.056. (12) The Director of Transportation may order the suspension or revocation of a certification issued under this section, as provided in ORS 315.061.

(1) A credit against taxes otherwise imposed under ORS chapter 316 shall be allowed for amounts contributed by the taxpayer during the tax year to a savings network account for higher education established under ORS 178.300 to 178.360 or an ABLE account established under ORS 178.380. A taxpayer who makes contributions to both types of account may claim the credit for the amounts listed in subsection (2) of this section for each type of account. (2) The amount of the credit allowed under this section shall be limited based on the taxpayers adjusted gross income and shall be the lesser of $300, if reported on a joint return, or $150, if reported on any other type of return, or the following: (a) The amount contributed, if the taxpayers adjusted gross income does not exceed $30,000; (b) 50 percent of the amount contributed, if the taxpayers adjusted gross income exceeds $30,000 but does not exceed $70,000; (c) 25 percent of the amount contributed, if the taxpayers adjusted gross income exceeds $70,000 but does not exceed $100,000; (d) 10 percent of the amount contributed, if the taxpayers adjusted gross income exceeds $100,000 but does not exceed $250,000; or (e) 5 percent of the amount contributed, if the taxpayers adjusted gross income exceeds $250,000. (3)(a) The Department of Revenue shall annually adjust the maximum credit amounts allowable under this section according to the cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year. The department shall first make this adjustment for a joint return by multiplying the maximum credit amount in subsection (2) of this section by the percentage (if any) by which the monthly averaged U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for the 12 consecutive months ending August 31 of the prior calendar year exceeds the monthly averaged U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for the 12 consecutive months ending August 31, 2018. (b) As used in this subsection, U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index means the U.S. City Average Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (All Items) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. (c) If any adjustment to the maximum credit amount for a joint return, as determined under paragraph (a) of this subsection, is not a multiple of $20, the adjustment shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $20. The department shall then adjust the maximum credit amount for all other types of returns so that it is half the maximum credit amount for a joint return. (4) A credit under this section is allowed for a preceding tax year for amounts contributed to a savings network account for higher education or to an ABLE account if the contribution is made before the taxpayer files a return or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the closing of the taxpayers tax year, whichever is earlier. (5) A credit is not allowed under this section for any amount that has been transferred into a savings network account for higher education from an individual development account, through a rollover, as provided in ORS 458.685 (3)(a)(A). (6) If the amount allowable as a credit under this section, when added to the sum of the amounts allowable as payment of tax under ORS 316.187 (withholding), ORS 316.583 (estimated tax), other tax prepayment amounts and other refundable credit amounts, exceeds the taxes imposed by ORS chapters 314 and 316 for the tax year (reduced by any nonrefundable credits allowable for purposes of ORS chapter 316 for the tax year), the amount of the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer as provided in ORS 316.502. (7) The credit shall be claimed on a form prescribed by the Department of Revenue that contains the information required by the department. (8) Spouses in a marriage who file separate returns for a taxable year may each claim a share of the tax credit that would have been allowed on a joint return in proportion to the adjusted gross income of each. (9) In the case of a credit allowed under this section: (a) A nonresident shall be allowed the credit in the proportion provided in ORS 316.117. (b) If a change in the status of the taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117. (c) If a change in the taxable year of the taxpayer occurs as described in ORS 314.085, or if the department terminates the taxpayers taxable year under ORS 314.440, the credit shall be prorated or computed in a manner consistent with ORS 314.085.

(b) If a change in the status of a taxpayer from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident occurs, the credit allowed under this section shall be determined in a manner consistent with ORS 316.117. (c) Spouses in a marriage who file separate returns for a taxable year may each claim a share of the tax credit that would have been allowed on a joint return in proportion to the contribution of each. (d) If a change in the taxable year of a taxpayer occurs as described in ORS 314.085, or if the Department of Revenue terminates the taxpayers taxable year under ORS 314.440, the credit allowed under this section shall be prorated or computed in a manner consistent with ORS 314.085.
