(2)(a) For purposes of this section, each asset shall be valued at its highest value as shown in the inventory, any amended or supplemental inventory, any interim account or the final account or statement in lieu of the final account filed under ORS 116.083, which may be based upon revaluation of the asset to reflect its then current fair market value. (b) If the highest value of an asset as shown in the inventory, any amended or supplemental inventory, any interim account or the final account or statement in lieu of the final account filed under ORS 116.083 was materially misstated at the time of filing of the document, the value of the asset is the highest correctly stated value of the asset as shown in the inventory, any amended or supplemental inventory, any interim account or the final account or statement in lieu of the final account filed under ORS 116.083. (3) Unless the court has granted a request for a different determination of the compensation of the personal representative under ORS 113.038, upon application to the court a personal representative is entitled to receive compensation for services as provided in this section. If there is more than one personal representative acting concurrently or consecutively, the compensation may not be increased, but may be divided among the personal representatives as they agree or as the court may order. The compensation is a commission upon the whole estate, as follows: (a) Upon the property subject to the jurisdiction of the court: (A) Seven percent of any sum not exceeding $1,000. (B) Four percent of all above $1,000 and not exceeding $10,000. (C) Three percent of all above $10,000 and not exceeding $50,000. (D) Two percent of all above $50,000. (b) One percent of the property, exclusive of life insurance proceeds, not subject to the jurisdiction of the court but reportable for Oregon estate tax or federal estate tax purposes. (4) In all cases, further compensation as is just and reasonable may be allowed by the court for any extraordinary and unusual services, including services not ordinarily required of a personal representative in the performance of duties as a personal representative. (5) When a decedent by will has made special provision for the compensation of a personal representative: (a) The personal representative is not entitled to any other compensation for services unless prior to appointment the personal representative signs and files with the clerk of the court a written renunciation of the compensation provided by the will. (b) If the assets of the estate are insufficient to pay in full all expenses or claims of the estate, the compensation of the personal representative may not exceed the compensation provided by subsections (3) and (4) of this section.",

Upon the petition of any interested person, the court, with such notice as it may prescribe, may order the estate of a decedent reopened if other property is discovered, if any necessary act remains unperformed or for any other proper cause appearing to the court. The court may reappoint the former personal representative, or appoint another personal representative, to administer any additional property or to perform such other acts as are considered necessary. The provisions of law as to original administration apply, in so far as applicable, to accomplish the purpose for which the estate is reopened, but a claim that already is adjudicated or barred may not be asserted in the reopened administration.",

(1) Within 10 years after the death of a decedent whose estate escheated in whole or in part to the state, or within eight years after the entry of a judgment or order escheating property of an estate to the state, a claim may be made for the property escheated, or the proceeds thereof, by or on behalf of a person not having actual knowledge of the escheat or by or on behalf of a person who at the time of the escheat was unable to prove entitlement to the escheated property. (2) The claim shall be made by a petition filed with the State Treasurer. The petition must include: (a) A declaration by the petitioner under penalty of perjury in the form required by ORCP 1 E or an unsworn declaration under ORS 194.800 to 194.835 if the declarant is physically outside the boundaries of the United States; (b) The age and place of residence of the claimant by whom or on whose behalf the petition is filed; (c) A brief description of the property or source of funds believed to have been escheated to the state; (d) That the claimant lawfully is entitled to the property or proceeds; (e) That at the time the property escheated to the state the claimant had no knowledge or notice thereof or was unable to prove entitlement to the escheated property and has subsequently acquired new evidence of that entitlement; (f) That the claimant claims the property or proceeds as an heir or devisee or as the personal representative of the estate of an heir or devisee, setting forth any relationship between the claimant and the decedent who at the time of death owned the escheated property; (g) That 10 years have not elapsed since the death of the decedent or that eight years have not elapsed since the entry of the judgment or order escheating the property to the state; and (h) If the petition is not filed by the claimant, the status of the petitioner. (3) If the State Treasurer determines that the claimant is entitled to escheated estate property, the State Treasurer shall: (a) Pay from the Unclaimed Property and Estates Fund the proportional share of the proceeds or value of the property without interest and subject to the proportional share of the costs of administering the estate, including attorney fees and personal representative fees paid by the estate; or (b) If personal or real property is in the Unclaimed Property and Estates Fund, transfer the property without interest and subject to a claim of the Unclaimed Property and Estates Fund of a proportional share of the costs of administering the estate, including attorney fees and personal representative fees paid by the estate, and any property taxes or other costs of managing or improving the property, whether incurred before or after the close of the estate. (4) If the person whose property escheated or reverted to the state was at any time a patient of a state institution in Oregon for persons with mental illness or of the Eastern Oregon Training Center, the reasonable unpaid cost of the care and maintenance of the person while a ward of the institution, regardless of when the cost was incurred, may be deducted from, or, if necessary, be offset in full against, the amount of the escheated property. The reasonable unpaid cost of care and maintenance shall be determined in accordance with ORS 179.701. (5) For the purposes of this section, the death of the decedent is presumed to have occurred on the date shown in the decedents certified copy of the death record or in any other similar document issued by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred or issued by an agency of the federal government. (6) A person aggrieved by a determination of the State Treasurer under this section may seek a contested case hearing under ORS 183.413 to 183.470.",
