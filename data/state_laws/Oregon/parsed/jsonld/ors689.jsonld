(4) The executive director of the board shall keep the seal of the board and shall affix it only in the manner prescribed by the board. (5) The board shall determine within 30 days prior to the beginning of each state fiscal year the fees to be collected for: (a) Examinations and reexaminations. (b) A pharmacist license.

(6) All moneys received under ORS 435.010 to 435.130 and 453.185 and this chapter shall be paid into the State Treasury and placed to the credit of the State Board of Pharmacy Account to be used only for the administration and enforcement of ORS 435.010 to 435.130 and this chapter. (7) The board may receive and expend funds, in addition to its biennial appropriation, from parties other than the state, provided: (a) The moneys are awarded for the pursuit of a specific objective that the board is authorized to accomplish by this chapter, or that the board is qualified to accomplish by reason of its jurisdiction or professional expertise; (b) The moneys are expended for the pursuit of the objective for which they are awarded; (c) Activities connected with or occasioned by the expenditures of the funds do not interfere with or impair the performance of the boards duties and responsibilities and do not conflict with the exercise of the boards powers as specified by this chapter; (d) The moneys are kept in a separate, special state account; and (e) Periodic reports are made to the Governor concerning the boards receipt and expenditure of the moneys. (8) The board may assign to each drug outlet under its jurisdiction, a uniform state number, coordinated where possible with all other states that adopt the same uniform numbering system. (9) The board or its authorized representatives shall have the power to investigate and gather evidence concerning alleged violations of the provisions of this chapter or of the rules of the board. (10) The president and vice president of the board may administer oaths in connection with the duties of the board. (11) The books, registers and records of the board as made and kept by the executive director, or under the supervision of the executive director, subject to the direction of the board, are prima facie evidence of the matter recorded in the books, registers and records, in any court of law. (12) The board may administer oaths, issue notices and subpoenas in the name of the board, enforce subpoenas in the manner authorized by ORS 183.440, hold hearings and perform such other acts as are reasonably necessary to carry out its duties under this chapter. (13)(a) Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, whenever a duly authorized representative of the board finds or has probable cause to believe that any drug or device is adulterated, misbranded or a new drug, as defined in Section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, for which there is no approval in effect pursuant to Section 505(b) of the federal Act nor an approved notice of claimed investigational exemption pursuant to Section 505(i) of the federal Act, or otherwise rendered unsafe for use as a result of fire, flood or other natural disaster, the representative shall affix to such drug or device a tag or other appropriate marking giving notice that such article is or is suspected of being adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise rendered unsafe and has been detained or embargoed and warning all persons not to remove or dispose of such article by sale or otherwise until provision for removal or disposal is given by the board, its agent or the court. No person shall remove or dispose of such embargoed drug or device by sale or otherwise without the permission of the board or its agent or, after summary proceedings have been instituted, without permission from the court. (b) When a drug or device detained or embargoed under paragraph (a) of this subsection has been declared by such representative to be adulterated, misbranded or a new drug, or rendered unsafe, the board shall, as soon as practical thereafter, petition the judge of the circuit court in whose jurisdiction the article is detained or embargoed for an order for condemnation of such article. If the judge determines that the drug or device so detained or embargoed is not adulterated or misbranded or rendered unsafe, the board shall direct the immediate removal of the tag or other marking. (c) If the court finds the detained or embargoed drug or device is adulterated or misbranded or rendered unsafe, such drug or device, after entry of the judgment, shall be destroyed at the expense of the owner under the supervision of a board representative and all court costs and fees, storage and other proper expense shall be borne by the owner of such drug or device. When the adulteration or misbranding can be corrected by proper labeling or processing of the drug or device, the court, after entry of the judgment and after such costs, fees and expenses have been paid and a good and sufficient bond has been posted, may direct that such drug or device be delivered to the owner thereof for such labeling or processing under the supervision of a board representative. Expense of such supervision shall be paid by the owner. Such bond shall be returned to the owner of the drug or device on representation to the court by the board that the drug or device is no longer in violation of the embargo and the expense of supervision has been paid. (d) It is the duty of the Attorney General to whom the board reports any violation of this subsection to cause appropriate proceedings to be instituted in the proper court without delay and to be prosecuted in the manner required by law. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the board to report violations whenever the board believes the publics interest will be adequately served in the circumstances by a suitable written notice or warning. (14) Except as otherwise provided to the contrary, the board shall exercise all of its duties, powers and authority in accordance with ORS chapter 183.",

(2) All pharmacists licensed in the State of Oregon on and after October 3, 1979, shall satisfactorily complete courses of study and satisfactorily continue their education by other means as determined by the State Board of Pharmacy in subjects relating to the practice of the profession of pharmacy in order to be eligible for renewal of licenses. (3) In accordance with applicable provisions of ORS chapter 183, the board shall adopt reasonable rules: (a) Prescribing the procedure and criteria for approval of continuing pharmacy education programs, including the number of hours of courses of study necessary to constitute a continuing pharmacy education unit and the number of continuing pharmacy education units required annually for renewal of a pharmacist license. (b) Prescribing the scope of the examinations given by the board including grading procedures. (c) Prescribing the content of the form to be submitted to the board certifying completion of an approved continuing pharmacy education program. (d) Necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter. (e) Prescribing the completion, at initial licensure and every 36 months thereafter, of: (A) A one-hour pain management education program approved by the board and developed based on recommendations of the Pain Management Commission; or (B) An equivalent pain management education program, as determined by the board. (4) In adopting rules pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, the board shall consider: (a) The need for formal regularly scheduled pharmacy education programs. (b) Alternate methods of study including home-study courses, seminars or other such programs for those persons who, upon written application to the board and for good cause shown, demonstrate their inability to attend regularly scheduled formal classroom programs. (c) The necessity for examinations or other evaluation methods used to ensure satisfactory completion of the continuing pharmacy education program. (5) The board may contract for the providing of educational programs to fulfill the requirements of this chapter. The board is further authorized to treat funds set aside for the purpose of continuing education as state funds for the purpose of accepting any funds made available under federal law on a matching basis for the promulgation and maintenance of programs of continuing education. In no instance shall the board require a greater number of hours of study than it provides or approves in the State of Oregon and which are available on the same basis to all licensed pharmacists. (6) The board may levy an additional fee, established by the board by rule, for each license renewal to carry out the provisions of this chapter.",

(2) Any person whose license issued pursuant to this chapter has been suspended, revoked or restricted pursuant to this chapter, whether voluntarily or by action of the board, shall have the right, at reasonable intervals, to petition the board for reinstatement of such license.

(1) As used in this section unless the context requires otherwise: (a) Brand name means the proprietary or trade name selected by the manufacturer and placed upon a drug, its container, label or wrapping at the time of packaging. (b) Dosage form means the physical formulation or medium in which the product is intended, manufactured and made available for use, including but not limited to tablets, capsules, oral solutions, aerosols, ointments, inhalers and suppositories, and the particular form of which utilizes a specific technology or mechanism to control, enhance or direct the release, targeting, systemic absorption or other delivery of a dosage regimen in the body. (c) Generic name means the official title of a drug or drug ingredients published in the latest edition of the official Pharmacopoeia, Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia or Formulary. (d) Substitute means to dispense without the prescribers express authorization a different drug product in place of the drug ordered or prescribed. (e) Therapeutically equivalent means drugs that are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for interstate distribution and the Food and Drug Administration has determined that the drugs will provide essentially the same efficacy and toxicity when administered to an individual in the same dosage regimen. (2) Except as limited by subsections (3) and (5) of this section, unless the purchaser instructs otherwise, a pharmacist may substitute as follows: (a) A drug product with the same generic name in the same strength, quantity, dose and dosage form as the prescribed drug which is, in the pharmacists professional opinion, therapeutically equivalent. (b) When the prescriber is not reasonably available for consultation and the prescribed drug does not utilize a unique delivery system technology, an oral tablet, capsule or liquid form of the prescribed drug so long as the form dispensed or administered has the same strength, dose and dose schedule and is therapeutically equivalent to the drug prescribed. (3) A practitioner may specify in writing, by a telephonic communication or by electronic transmission that there may be no substitution for the specified brand name drug in a prescription. (4) A pharmacy shall post a sign in a location easily seen by patrons at the counter where prescriptions are dispensed or administered stating that, This pharmacy may be able to substitute a less expensive drug which is therapeutically equivalent to the one prescribed by your doctor unless you do not approve. The printing on the sign must be in block letters not less than one inch in height. If the pharmacist has reasonable cause to believe that the purchaser cannot read the sign or comprehend its content, the pharmacist shall endeavor to explain the meaning of the sign. (5) A pharmacist may substitute a drug product under this section only when there will be a savings in or no increase in cost to the purchaser. (6) If the practitioner prescribes a drug by its generic name, the pharmacist shall, consistent with reasonable professional judgment, dispense or administer the lowest retail cost, effective brand which is in stock. (7) Except as provided in subsection (8) of this section, when a pharmacist dispenses a substituted drug as authorized by subsection (2) of this section, the pharmacist shall label the prescription container with the name of the dispensed drug. If the dispensed drug does not have a brand name, the pharmacist shall label the prescription container with the generic name of the drug dispensed along with the name of the drug manufacturer. (8) A prescription dispensed by a pharmacist must bear upon the label the name of the medication in the container or shall be labeled as intended by the prescriber. (9) The substitution of any drug by a pharmacist or the pharmacists employer pursuant to this section does not constitute the practice of medicine. (10) A substitution of drugs made by a pharmacist or the pharmacists employer in accordance with this section and any rules that the State Board of Pharmacy may adopt thereunder does not constitute evidence of negligence if the substitution was made within reasonable and prudent practice of pharmacy or if the substituted drug was accepted in a generally recognized formulary or government list. (11) Failure of a practitioner to specify that no substitution is authorized does not constitute evidence of negligence unless the practitioner knows that the health condition of the patient for whom the practitioner is prescribing warrants the use of the brand name drug product and not the substituted drug.",

(2) Not later than five business days after the dispensing of a biological product, the pharmacy or pharmacist, or the pharmacists designee, shall communicate the specific biological product dispensed to the patient, including the name and manufacturer of the biological product, by making an entry into an electronic system that the prescribing practitioner can access electronically and that is: (a) An interoperable electronic medical records system; (b) An electronic prescribing technology; (c) A pharmacy benefit management system; or (d) A pharmacy record. (3) If the pharmacy or pharmacist, or the pharmacists designee, does not have access to an electronic system described in subsection (2) of this section, the pharmacy or pharmacist, or the pharmacists designee, shall communicate not later than five business days to the prescribing practitioner the specific biological product dispensed to the patient, including the name and manufacturer of the biological product. The communication may be by facsimile, electronic mail, telephone or another method. (4) If the biological product is dispensed to a patient in a clinic, community-based care facility, hospital or long term care facility, an entry made to the patients medical record of the specific biological product dispensed to the patient, including the name and manufacturer of the biological product, satisfies the communication requirements of subsection (2) of this section. (5) Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (3) of this section, the pharmacy or pharmacist, or the pharmacists designee, is not required to communicate to the prescribing practitioner the specific biological product dispensed to the patient if: (a) The United States Food and Drug Administration has not approved an interchangeable biological product for the prescribed biological product; (b) The pharmacy or pharmacist is refilling a prescription and the pharmacy or pharmacist is dispensing the same biological product that was dispensed the last time the pharmacy or pharmacist filled or refilled the patients prescription; or (c) The pharmacy or pharmacist is filling a prescription for a vaccine. (6) The entries described in subsections (2) and (4) of this section or the communication described in subsection (3) of this section provides notice to the prescribing provider of the dispensation of a biological product to a patient.

(8)(a) For purposes of this section, the board shall adopt by rule definitions for the terms biological product and interchangeable. (b) The rule defining the term biological product must be consistent with 42 U.S.C. 262(i)(1). (c) The rule defining the term interchangeable must: (A) For biological products licensed under the Public Health Service Act, define the biological products that may be substituted for other biological products as having been determined by the United States Food and Drug Administration as meeting the standards in 42 U.S.C. 262(k)(4); and (B) For biological products approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq., define the biological products that may be substituted for other biological products as having been determined by the United States Food and Drug Administration as therapeutically equivalent as set forth in the latest edition or supplement of the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations.

(1) In a hospital or long term care facility having a pharmacy and employing a pharmacist, the pharmacy and pharmacist are subject to the requirements of this chapter, except that in a hospital when a pharmacist is not in attendance, pursuant to standing orders of the pharmacist, a registered nurse supervisor on the written order of a person authorized to prescribe a drug may withdraw such drug in such volume or amount as needed for administration to or treatment of an inpatient or outpatient until regular pharmacy services are available in accordance with the rules adopted by the State Board of Pharmacy. However, the board may grant an exception to the requirement for a written order by issuing a special permit authorizing the registered nurse supervisor in a hospital to dispense medication on the oral order of a person authorized to prescribe a drug. An inpatient care facility which does not have a pharmacy must have a drug room. In an inpatient care facility having a drug room as may be authorized by rule of the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority, the drug room is not subject to the requirements of this chapter relating to pharmacies. However, a drug room must be supervised by a pharmacist and is subject to the rules of the board. When a pharmacist is not in attendance, any person authorized by the prescriber or by the pharmacist on written order may withdraw such drug in such volume or amount as needed for administration to or treatment of a patient, entering such withdrawal in the record of the responsible pharmacist. (2) In a hospital having a drug room, any drug may be withdrawn from storage in the drug room by a registered nurse supervisor on the written order of a licensed practitioner in such volume or amount as needed for administration to and treatment of an inpatient or outpatient in the manner set forth in subsection (1) of this section and within the authorized scope of practice. (3) A hospital having a drug room shall cause accurate and complete records to be kept of the receipt, withdrawal from stock and use or other disposal of all legend drugs stored in the drug room. Such record shall be open to inspection by agents of the board and other qualified authorities. (4) In an inpatient care facility other than a hospital, the drug room shall contain only prescribed drugs already prepared for patients therein and such emergency drug supply as may be authorized by rule by the Department of Human Services. (5) The requirements of this section shall not apply to facilities described in ORS 441.065. (6) A registered nurse who is an employee of a local health department that is registered by the board under ORS 689.305 may, pursuant to the order of a person authorized to prescribe a drug or device, dispense a drug or device to a client of the local health department for purposes of caries prevention, birth control or prevention or treatment of a communicable disease. Such dispensing shall be subject to rules jointly adopted by the board and the Oregon Health Authority. (7) The board shall adopt rules authorizing a pharmacist to delegate to a registered nurse the authority to withdraw prescription drugs from a manufacturers labeled container for administration to persons confined in penal institutions including, but not limited to, adult and juvenile correctional facilities. A penal institution, in consultation with a pharmacist, shall develop policies and procedures regarding medication management, procurement and distribution. A pharmacist shall monitor a penal institution for compliance with the policies and procedures and shall perform drug utilization reviews. The penal institution shall submit to the board for approval a written agreement between the pharmacist and the penal institution regarding medication policies and procedures.",
