(1) Except as otherwise provided by law, all state courts and all commissions, departments and divisions in the judicial branch of state government shall offer to assign the liquidated and delinquent accounts of the state court, commission, department or division to a private collection agency, or to the Department of Revenue under the provisions of ORS 293.250, not later than: (a) One year from the date the account was liquidated if no payment has been received on the account within that year; or (b) One year from the date of receipt of the most recent payment on the account. (2) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section prohibits a state court or a commission, department or division in the judicial branch of state government from assigning a liquidated and delinquent account to a private collection agency at any time within the one-year period, or from assigning a liquidated and delinquent account to the Department of Revenue during the one-year period, if that assignment is otherwise allowed by law. (3) Nothing in this section prevents a state court or a commission, department or division in the judicial branch of state government from assigning an account to the Department of Revenue for the purpose of seeking an offset against tax refunds or other amounts due the debtor at the time the account is assigned to a private collection agency. A state court and any commission, department or division in the judicial branch of state government that assigns the same account to both the Department of Revenue and a private collection agency shall ensure that both the Department of Revenue and the private collection agency are kept informed of the status of all collections made on the account. (4) If a private collection agency is unable to collect on an account assigned under this section, the private collection agency shall notify the state court, commission, department or division that assigned the account that the private collection agency is unable to collect on the account and that the private collection agency will relinquish the account. The private collection agency shall relinquish the account within a reasonable time or within such time as may be set by agreement. A private collection agency that is assigned an account under this section shall be held to the same standard of confidentiality, service and courtesy imposed on a state court in collecting on liquidated and delinquent accounts. (5) If a liquidated and delinquent account is assigned to the Department of Revenue as provided in ORS 293.250, the Department of Revenue shall have one year from the date of liquidation, or from the date of receipt of the most recent payment on the account, to collect a payment. If the Department of Revenue does not collect a payment within the one-year period or if one year has elapsed since the date of receipt of the most recent payment on the account, the Department of Revenue shall notify the state court, commission, department or division that assigned the account. The state court, commission, department or division shall then immediately offer assignment of the account to a private collection agency. (6) For the purposes of this section, a state court or a commission, department or division in the judicial branch of state government shall be considered to have offered an account for assignment to a private collection agency if: (a) The terms of the offer are of a type generally accepted by the collections industry for the type of account to be assigned; and (b) The offer is made to a private collection agency that engages in the business of collecting the type of account to be assigned or made generally to private collection agencies through a bid or request for proposal process. (7) The offer of assignment of accounts required under this section may be made by the State Court Administrator on behalf of some or all of the state courts and on behalf of some or all of the commissions, departments and divisions in the judicial branch of state government.",

(2)(a) Upon filing with the Secretary of State an oath of office as a senior judge as prescribed in ORS 1.212, a senior judge is eligible for temporary assignment, with the consent of the senior judge, by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court or the designee of the Chief Justice, to a state court as provided in this subsection, whenever the Chief Justice or the designee of the Chief Justice determines that the assignment is reasonably necessary and will promote the efficient administration of justice. (b) A senior judge who retired from the Supreme Court may be assigned under this subsection to any state court. (c) A senior judge who retired from a court other than the Supreme Court may be assigned under this subsection to any state court other than the Supreme Court. (d) A senior judge assigned to serve as a circuit court judge may be assigned under this subsection to serve in any one or more counties or judicial districts during the term of the assignment. (3) The assignment of a senior judge shall designate the court or courts to which the judge is assigned and the duration of the assignment. The Chief Justice or the designee of the Chief Justice shall promptly notify the senior judge, and the court or courts to which the judge is assigned, of the assignment. (4) Each senior judge assigned as provided in this section has all the judicial powers and duties, while serving under the assignment, of a regularly elected and qualified judge of the court to which the senior judge is assigned. The powers, jurisdiction and judicial authority of the senior judge in respect to any case or matter tried or heard by the senior judge while serving under the assignment shall continue beyond the expiration of the assignment so far as may be necessary to: (a) Decide and dispose of any case or matter on trial or held under advisement. (b) Hear and decide any motion for a new trial or for a judgment notwithstanding a verdict, or objections to any cost bill, that may be filed in the case. (c) Settle a transcript for appeal and grant extensions of time therefor. (5) A senior judge assigned as provided in this section shall receive as compensation for each day the senior judge is actually engaged in the performance of duties under the assignment an amount equal to five percent of the gross monthly salary of a regularly elected and qualified judge of the court to which the senior judge is assigned, or one-half of that daily compensation for services of one-half day or less. However, a retired judge shall not receive for services as a senior judge during any calendar year a sum of money which when added to the amount of any judicial retirement pay received by the senior judge for the year exceeds the annual salary of a judge of the court from which the senior judge retired. The compensation shall be paid upon the certificate of the senior judge that the services were performed for the number of days shown in the certificate. Services by a senior judge under an assignment and receipt of compensation for services shall not reduce or otherwise affect the amount of any retirement pay to which the senior judge otherwise would be entitled. (6) A senior judge assigned to a court located outside the county in Oregon in which the senior judge regularly resides shall receive, in addition to daily compensation, reimbursement for hotel bills and traveling expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of duties under the assignment. The expenses shall be paid upon presentation of an itemized statement of the expenses, certified by the senior judge to be correct.",

(b) Consult with other judges of the court in which the subject judge serves and other persons who may have knowledge concerning the alleged disability. (c) Conduct other inquiry in respect to the alleged disability as the Chief Justice considers appropriate.

(4) If, after inquiry, and on clear and convincing evidence, the Chief Justice determines that the subject judge has a permanent disability, or that the subject judge has a temporary disability and informal disposition is not appropriate or the subject judge does not agree to informal disposition, the Chief Justice may file a written request for an investigation under ORS 1.310 (2) or a complaint under ORS 1.425, as the Chief Justice considers appropriate. (5) When the Chief Justice enters into an informal disposition with a subject judge under subsection (3) of this section, or files a written request or complaint in respect to a subject judge under subsection (4) of this section, or determines that a subject judge does not have a disability, the Chief Justice shall prepare a written summary of the nature of the complaint or information received, the inquiry conducted and the basis for the determination.

(1) As used in this section: (a) Chief Justice means the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Oregon, except that, if the Chief Justice is the subject judge, then the term Chief Justice means the one of the remaining judges of the Supreme Court who has served the longest period of time as a judge of that court. (b) Disability means physical or mental incapacitation of such a degree as to cause a judge to be unable to discharge the duties of judicial office. (c) Judge includes any judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, the Oregon Tax Court, or any circuit court, of the State of Oregon. (d) Subject judge means any judge whose alleged disability is involved in proceedings under this section. (2) Any judge who becomes disabled may be retired in the manner provided in this section. The Governor, the Chief Justice, the Judicial Conference or the Board of Governors of the Oregon State Bar may file at any time with the Secretary of State a written request for an investigation to determine whether a judge named in the request has a disability. Upon receipt of a request, the Secretary of State shall transmit to the subject judge a certified copy of the request, with a notice to the effect that, unless the judge files a resignation within 45 days after the date of the notice, an investigation will be made to determine whether the judge has a disability. The certified copy and notice shall be served on the subject judge, either by delivering them to the judge in person or by transmitting them by registered mail or by certified mail with return receipt to the judge at the last residence address of the judge as shown in the records of the Secretary of State. (3) If the subject judge fails to file a resignation within 45 days after the date of the notice, the Secretary of State, within 10 days after the expiration of that period, shall transmit to the Commission on Judicial Fitness and Disability certified copies of the request and notice, with a certificate to the effect: (a) That the Secretary of State served the notice and copy of the request on the subject judge as provided in subsection (2) of this section; and (b) That the judge did not file a resignation. (4) Upon receipt of the certified copies and certificate referred to in subsection (3) of this section, the commission shall make the requested investigation and, after hearing, determine whether the subject judge has a disability. The commission shall prepare an official record that shall include the testimony taken and the exhibits considered. If the subject judge refuses or is unable to attend, the commission may proceed with the hearing in the absence of the judge. (5) If a majority of the members of the commission determines that the subject judge in fact has a disability, the members shall make and sign written findings of fact upon which the determination is made and transmit the findings to the Secretary of State. If no appeal is filed, the office of the judge shall become vacant 10 days after the filing of the findings, and thereupon the Secretary of State shall certify to the Governor the existence of the vacancy. If a majority of the members of the commission does not find that the subject judge has a disability, the members shall sign and file with the Secretary of State a written report to that effect, and thereupon the proceeding shall terminate. (6) The commission may prescribe rules of procedure for the conduct of the investigation and fix the time and place of the hearing, giving the subject judge due notice thereof. The fees and mileage allowance of witnesses, including experts, shall be fixed by the commission. (7) A judge retired under the provisions of this section may not be appointed as judge pro tempore to serve upon any court of the State of Oregon. (8) The subject judge may appeal to the Supreme Court from a determination by the commission that the judge has a disability, by filing a notice with the Secretary of State within 10 days after the date of filing of the written findings of fact by the commission. The Secretary of State shall thereupon notify the commission and the Chief Justice. The commission shall forthwith transmit the official record to the Supreme Court, which upon receipt of the record shall have full jurisdiction of the proceeding. (9) The Supreme Court shall review the proceeding de novo on the record with authority to affirm, reverse or annul the determination. Prior to a final determination, remand may also be made to the commission for additional findings of fact. In the event that the Supreme Court reverses or annuls the determination of the commission, the proceeding shall thereupon terminate and notice to that effect shall be filed with the Secretary of State. If the determination of the commission is affirmed, a decision to that effect shall be filed with the Secretary of State and the office of the subject judge shall forthwith become vacant. Thereupon, the Secretary of State shall certify to the Governor the existence of the vacancy.",

The Supreme Court may censure the judge or it may order the judge suspended or removed from office. (2) If the commission has agreed to allow the judge to submit a consent to censure, suspension or removal, the Supreme Court shall review the stipulation of facts and the disciplinary action to which the judge has consented. If the Supreme Court approves the consent, the court shall censure the judge or order the judge suspended or removed from office pursuant to the terms of the consent.

The hearing shall be conducted as though the consent and stipulation had never been entered into, and the stipulations made by the judge may not be considered as evidence by the commission in the hearing. If the Supreme Court accepts the stipulation of facts but rejects the disciplinary action agreed to by the judge and the commission, the court may remand the matter to the commission for such further fact-finding as the court may direct on the issue of the appropriate discipline for the conduct, and may request that the matter be briefed and argued before the court. The Supreme Court may thereafter censure the judge, or enter an order suspending or removing the judge, as the court finds appropriate under the law and the facts. (3) Upon an order for removal, the judge shall be removed from office and the salary of the judge shall cease and the office of the judge is vacant on the date of such order. (4) Upon an order of suspension, the judge shall be suspended from office for the period specified in the order and the salary of the judge shall cease, if so ordered, from the date of the order until the end of the specified period.
