(1) As used in this section: (a) Charitable gift annuity has the meaning given that term in section 501(m)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended and in effect on January 1, 2006. (b) Charitable organization means an organization to which contributions may be made that are charitable contributions under section 170(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended and in effect on January 1, 2006. (2) The Insurance Code does not apply to a charitable organization that issues charitable gift annuities if, on the date that the charitable organization issues the charitable gift annuity, the charitable organization: (a) Has a minimum of $300,000 in net assets as shown by an annual audited financial statement prepared by an independent certified public accountant and kept on file by the charitable organization; (b) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, has been in continuous operation for at least five years or is a successor to or an affiliate of a charitable organization that has been in continuous operation for at least five years; and (c) Maintains a separate and distinct trust fund as a reserve fund adequate to meet the future payments under all outstanding annuity agreements. The amount in the reserve fund must be an amount no less than an amount computed on the basis of the transfers to which it relates in accordance with the standard of valuation based on current mortality tables and interest rate recommended by a national organization organized for the purpose of providing educational and other services to American charities regarding gift annuities and other forms of planned gifts. The reserve fund may include one or more single premium annuities that pay the entire amount of one or more charitable gift annuities issued by the charitable organization if each single premium annuity is issued by an authorized insurer that is also authorized to transact insurance in the state in which the charitable organization has its principal office and in the state in which the single premium annuity is issued. (3) The Insurance Code does not apply to an educational institution or nonprofit corporation that issued a charitable gift annuity before January 1, 2006, under a certificate of authority issued under ORS 731.704 (repealed in 2005). (4) When a charitable organization that is subject to subsection (2) of this section enters into an agreement for a charitable gift annuity, the charitable organization shall disclose in writing to the donor that the charitable gift annuity is not issued by an insurance company, is not subject to regulation by the State of Oregon and is not protected by an insurance guaranty association. (5) A charitable organization that is not subject to subsection (2) of this section must hold a certificate of authority to issue charitable gift annuities. [2005 c.31 2] Note:",

(1) The Attorney General upon request of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may proceed in the courts of this state or any reciprocal state to enforce an order or decision in any court proceeding or in any administrative proceeding before the director. (2) As used in this section: (a) Reciprocal state means any state the laws of which contain procedures substantially similar to those specified in this section for the enforcement of decrees or orders in equity issued by courts located in other states, against any insurer incorporated or authorized to do business in such state. (b) Foreign decree means any decree or order in equity of a court located in a reciprocal state, including a court of the United States located therein, against any insurer incorporated or authorized to do business in this state. (c) Qualified party means a state regulatory agency acting in its capacity to enforce the insurance laws of its state. (3) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services of this state shall determine which states qualify as reciprocal states and shall maintain at all times an up-to-date list of such states. (4) A copy of any foreign decree authenticated in accordance with the statutes of this state may be filed in the office of the clerk of any circuit court of this state. The clerk, upon verifying with the director that the decree or order qualifies as a foreign decree shall treat the foreign decree in the same manner as a judgment of a circuit court of this state. A foreign decree so filed has the same effect and shall be deemed as a judgment of a circuit court of this state, and is subject to the same procedures, defenses and proceedings for reopening, vacating, or staying as a judgment of a circuit court of this state and may be enforced or satisfied in like manner. (5)(a) At the time of the filing of the foreign decree, the Attorney General shall make and file with the clerk of the court an affidavit setting forth the name and last-known post-office address of the defendant. (b) Promptly upon the filing of the foreign decree and the affidavit, the clerk shall mail notice of the filing of the foreign decree to the defendant at the address given and to the director of this state and shall make a note of the mailing in the register of the court. In addition, the Attorney General may mail a notice of the filing of the foreign decree to the defendant and to the director of this state and may file proof of mailing with the clerk. Lack of mailing notice of filing by the clerk shall not affect the enforcement proceedings if proof of mailing by the Attorney General has been filed. (c) No execution or other process for enforcement of a foreign decree filed under subsection (4) of this section shall issue until 30 days after the date the decree is filed. (6)(a) If the defendant shows the circuit court that an appeal from the foreign decree is pending or will be taken, or that a stay of execution has been granted, the court shall stay enforcement of the foreign decree until the appeal is concluded, the time for appeal expires, or the stay of execution expires or is vacated, upon proof that the defendant has furnished the security for the satisfaction of the decree required by the state in which it was rendered. (b) If the defendant shows the circuit court any ground upon which enforcement of a judgment of any circuit court of this state would be stayed, the court shall stay enforcement of the foreign decree for an appropriate period, upon requiring the same security for satisfaction of the decree which is required in this state for a judgment.",

(g) The insurer fails to comply with ORS 742.534 (1). (h) The insurer has failed to comply with ORS 476.270 (1), (2) or (3) or 654.097 (1).

(4) Reinsurance ceded as authorized by ORS 731.508 shall be deducted in determining risk retained. As to surety risks, deduction also shall be made of the amount assumed by any established incorporated cosurety and the value of any security deposited, pledged, or held subject to the suretys consent and for the suretys protection. (5) As to alien insurers, this section relates only to risks and surplus to policyholders of the insurers United States branch. (6) As used in this section, surplus to policyholders, in addition to the insurers capital and surplus, includes any voluntary reserves that are not required pursuant to law, includes the contingency reserve held for mortgage insurance as required by ORS 733.100, and shall be determined from the last sworn statement of the insurer on file with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, or by the last report of examination of the insurer, whichever is the more recent at time of assumption of risk. (7) This section does not apply to wet marine and transportation insurance or to any policy or type of coverage as to which the maximum possible loss to the insurer is not readily ascertainable on issuance of the policy.",

The director shall not approve or accept any such reinsurance by a ceding domestic insurer in an unauthorized insurer which the director finds for good cause would be contrary to the interests of the policyholders or stockholders of such domestic insurer. (3) Credit shall not be allowed, as an asset or as a deduction from liability, to any ceding insurer for reinsurance unless the reinsurance contract provides, in substance, that in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer, the reinsurance shall be payable under a contract or contracts reinsured by the assuming insurer on the basis of reported claims allowed by the court hearing the liquidation proceeding, without diminution because of the insolvency of the ceding insurer. Such payments shall be made directly to the ceding insurer or to its domiciliary liquidator except: (a) When the contract or other written agreement specifically provides another payee of the reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the ceding insurer; or (b) When the assuming insurer, with the consent of the direct insured or insureds, has assumed the policy obligations of the ceding insurer as direct obligations of the assuming insurer to the payees under such policies and in substitution for the obligations of the ceding insurer to such payees. (4) For the purposes of subsection (3) of this section, the reinsurance agreement may provide that the domiciliary liquidator of an insolvent ceding insurer shall, within a reasonable time after the claim is filed in the liquidation proceeding, give written notice to the assuming insurer of the pendency of a claim against the ceding insurer on the contract reinsured. During the pendency of the claim, an assuming insurer may investigate the claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding in which the claim is to be adjudicated any defenses that the assuming insurer determines to be available to the ceding insurer or its liquidator. The expense may be filed as a claim against the insolvent ceding insurer to the extent of a proportionate share of the benefit that may accrue to the ceding insurer solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the assuming insurer. When two or more assuming insurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in interest elect to interpose one or more defenses to the claim, the expense shall be apportioned in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreement as though the expense had been incurred by the ceding insurer. (5) The director may disallow credit that would otherwise be allowed if the director determines that allowing credit would be contrary to accurate financial reporting or proper financial management, or may be hazardous to policyholders of the insurer or the insurance-buying public generally. The director may make such a determination only according to standards established by the director by rule. This subsection applies only to insurers who transact life insurance or health insurance, or both. (6) Upon request of the director, a ceding insurer promptly shall inform the director in writing of the cancellation or any other material change of any of its reinsurance treaties or arrangements.

(b) If an accredited reinsurer maintains a trust fund to fully secure the accredited reinsurers obligations under ORS 731.509 (8) and the trust fund is a multibeneficiary trust, the accredited reinsurer shall maintain separate trust accounts for the obligations the accredited reinsurer incurs under reinsurance agreements the accredited reinsurer issued or renewed as an accredited reinsurer with reduced security, as provided under this section or under comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions, and for obligations the accredited reinsurer incurs that are subject to ORS 731.509 (8). (c) The minimum trusteed surplus requirements under ORS 731.509 (8) do not apply to an accredited reinsurer that maintains a multibeneficiary trust for the purpose of securing obligations under this subsection, except that the trust must maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of $10,000,000. (8) The director shall reduce the allowable credit for ceding insurers by an amount that is proportionate to any deficiency in the security required for an accredited reinsurer under this section. The director may also reduce the allowable credit further if the director finds that a material risk exists that the accredited reinsurer will not pay the accredited reinsurers obligations in full when due. (9)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, the director shall require an accredited reinsurer that has become inactive or has voluntarily surrendered accreditation as an accredited reinsurer, or for which the director has revoked or suspended accreditation, to secure 100 percent of the reinsurers obligations. (b) The security requirement described in paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply to an accredited reinsurer that is inactive, or for which the director has suspended accreditation, if the director maintains a high rating for the reinsurer under subsection (6) of this section. (10) The director may accredit an assuming insurer as a reinsurer in this state if a jurisdiction that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has qualified as meeting the associations financial standards and accreditation has certified the assuming insurer as a reinsurer. The director may also assign to the accredited reinsurer the rating that the qualifying jurisdiction assigned to the accredited reinsurer. (11) An accredited reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may apply to the director to become inactive and to qualify for a reduction in security for the business the accredited reinsurer maintains. An inactive accredited reinsurer shall comply with all other applicable requirements of this section and the director shall assign a rating to the accredited reinsurer that accounts for the reasons that the accredited reinsurer is not assuming new business, if the reasons are relevant to the rating. (12)(a) The director may suspend or revoke an assuming insurers accreditation as a reinsurer in this state if the assuming insurer fails to meet applicable requirements for accreditation. (b) The director shall give an accredited reinsurer notice and an opportunity for a hearing before taking action under paragraph (a) of this subsection and a suspension or revocation is not effective until after the directors final order unless: (A) The accredited reinsurer waives the opportunity for a hearing; (B) The director bases the final order on regulatory action by the accredited reinsurers domiciliary jurisdiction or on the accredited reinsurers having voluntarily surrendered or terminated the accredited reinsurers authorization to transact insurance or reinsurance in the domiciliary jurisdiction or in a jurisdiction whose certification of the reinsurer formed the basis upon which the director accredited the reinsurer in this state under subsection (10) of this section; or (C) The director finds that an emergency requires immediate action and a court does not stay the directors action. (13) A reinsurance contract issued or renewed after the director suspends an accredited reinsurers certification does not qualify for credit unless the reinsurer secures the reinsurers obligations in accordance with ORS 731.510. The director may not grant credit for reinsurance after the effective date of the directors revocation of accreditation unless the reinsurer secures the reinsurers obligations in accordance with subsections (6), (7) and (9) of this section or ORS 731.510. (14) The director may adopt rules to implement the provisions of this section including, but not limited to, rules that adopt guidelines, rules, regulations or interpretive letters from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that apply to reinsurance collateral requirements for alien reinsurers.",

      "text": "director has revoked accreditation of the assuming insurer after notice and opportunity for hearing. (6) The director shall allow credit if the reinsurance is ceded to a foreign assuming insurer or a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer meeting all of the following requirements: (a) The foreign assuming insurer must be domiciled in a state employing standards regarding credit for reinsurance that equal or exceed the standards applicable under this section. The United States branch of an alien assuming insurer must be entered through a state employing such standards. (b) The foreign assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer must maintain a combined capital and surplus in an amount not less than $20,000,000. The requirement of this paragraph does not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system. (c) The foreign assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer must submit to the authority of the director to examine the foreign assuming insurers or the alien assuming insurers books and records. (7) The director shall allow credit if the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that maintains a trust fund meeting the requirements of this subsection and subsection (8) of this section and that also complies with other requirements of this subsection and subsection (8) of this section. The trust fund must be maintained in a qualified United States financial institution, as defined in ORS 731.510 (1), for the payment of the valid claims of the assuming insurers United States policyholders and ceding insurers and the assigns and successors in interest of the policyholders and ceding insurers. The assuming insurer must report annually to the director information that is substantially the same as information authorized insurers must report on the annual statement form under ORS 731.574, in order to enable the director to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund. The assuming insurer shall submit to the directors examination of the assuming insurers books and records and shall pay to the director the expenses of the examination. (8) The following requirements apply to the following categories of assuming insurers: (a)(A) For a single assuming insurer, the trust fund must consist of funds in trust in an amount not less than the assuming insurers liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers. In addition, except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the assuming insurer must maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than $20,000,000. (B) At any time after the assuming insurer permanently discontinues underwriting, for at least three full years, new business that the trust secures, the commissioner that has principal regulatory oversight over the trust may authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after finding based on an assessment of the risk that the new required surplus level is adequate to protect United States ceding insurers, policyholders and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and must consider all material risk factors including, if applicable, the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurers liquidity or solvency. The commissioner may not reduce the amount of the minimum required trusteed surplus below 30 percent of the assuming insurers liabilities that are attributable to reinsurance that United States ceding insurers covered by the trust have ceded. (b) For a group that includes incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters: (A) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception, amendment or renewal date on or after August 1, 1995, the trust must consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the groups several liabilities attributable to business United States domiciled ceding insurers have ceded to any member of the group. (B) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception date on or before July 31, 1995, and not amended or renewed after that date, notwithstanding the other provisions of ORS 731.509, 731.510, 731.511, 731.512 and 731.516, the trust must consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the groups several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to business written in the United States. (C) In addition to the trusts described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the group shall maintain in trust a trusteed surplus of which $100,000,000 must be held jointly for the benefit of the United States domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account. (D) The incorporated members of the group may not engage in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and are subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the groups domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members. (E) Within 90 days after the groups financial statements are due to be filed with the groups domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the director an annual certification by the groups domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member or, if certification is unavailable, financial statements of each underwriter member of the group prepared by independent certified public accountants. (c) For the group of incorporated insurers described in this paragraph, the trust must be in an amount equal to the groups several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of the group. This paragraph applies to a group of incorporated insurers under common administration that complies with the annual reporting requirements contained in subsection (7) of this section and that has continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three years immediately before applying for accreditation. Such a group must have an aggregate policyholders surplus of $10,000,000,000 and must submit to the authority of this state to examine the groups books and records and bear the expense of the examination. The group shall also maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which $100,000,000 must be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the group as additional security for any such liabilities. Each member of the group shall make available to the director an annual certification of the members solvency by the members domiciliary regulator and the members independent certified public accountant. (d) The form of the trust and any amendment to the trust must be approved by the insurance commissioner of the state in which the trust is domiciled or by the insurance commissioner of another state who, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust. (e) The form of the trust and any trust amendments also must be filed with the insurance commissioner of every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled. The trust instrument must provide that contested claims are valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust must vest legal title to the trusts assets in the trusts trustees for the benefit of the assuming insurers United States ceding insurers and the assigns and successors in interest of the ceding insurers. The trust and the assuming insurer are subject to examination as determined by the director. The trust must remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer has outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust. (f) Not later than March 1 of each year, the trustees of each trust shall report to the director in writing the balance of the trust, list the trusts investments at the preceding year end and certify the date of termination of the trust, if a termination is planned, or certify that the trust will not expire prior to the following December 31. (9) The director shall allow credit if the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that does not meet the requirements of subsection (4), (5), (6) or (7) of this section or ORS 731.511 (1) or (4), but only as to the insurance of risks located in jurisdictions in which the reinsurance is required by applicable law or regulation of that jurisdiction. (10) If the assuming insurer is not licensed, accredited or certified to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state, the director may not allow the credit permitted by subsections (6) and (7) of this section unless the assuming insurer agrees in the reinsurance agreement to the provisions stated in this subsection. This subsection does not conflict with or override the obligation of the parties to a reinsurance agreement to arbitrate the parties disputes, if such an obligation is created in the agreement. The assuming insurer must agree in the reinsurance agreement: (a) That if the assuming insurer fails to perform the assuming insurers obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, shall submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in any state of the United States, will comply with all requirements necessary to give the court jurisdiction and will abide by the final decision of the court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal; and (b) To designate the director or a designated attorney as the assuming insurers true and lawful attorney upon whom any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding company may be served. (11) If the assuming insurer does not meet the requirements of subsection (4), (5) or (6) of this section or ORS 731.511 (1) or (4), the director may not allow the credit permitted by subsection (7) of this section unless the assuming insurer agrees in the trust agreements to the following conditions: (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions in the trust instrument, if the trust fund is inadequate because the trust fund contains an amount less than the applicable amount required by subsection (8)(a), (b) or (c) of this section, or if the grantor of the trust has been declared insolvent or placed into receivership, rehabilitation, liquidation or similar proceedings under the laws of the grantors state or country of domicile, the trustee shall comply with an order of the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight over the trust or with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the trustee to transfer to the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight all the assets of the trust fund. (b) The assets must be distributed by and claims must be filed with and valued by the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight in accordance with the laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that apply to the liquidation of domestic insurance companies. (c) If the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight determines that the assets of the trust fund or any part of the assets is not necessary to satisfy the claims of the United States ceding insurers of the grantor of the trust, the insurance commissioner of the state in which the trust is domiciled shall return the assets or part of the assets in accordance with the laws of the state and the terms of the trust agreement that are consistent with the laws of the state. (d) The grantor shall waive any right otherwise available to the grantor under United States law that is inconsistent with this subsection.",

(2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a mortgage insurer shall not have outstanding at any time a policyholders position greater than 25. (3)(a) The Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services may waive the requirement in subsection (2) of this section in response to the request of a mortgage insurer if the director finds that the mortgage insurers policyholders position is reasonable in relation to the mortgage insurers aggregate insured risk and adequate to the mortgage insurers financial needs.

(4) In determining whether a mortgage insurers requested policyholders position is reasonable in relation to the mortgage insurers aggregate insured risk and adequate to the mortgage insurers financial needs, the director may consider the following factors: (a) The size of the mortgage insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and other appropriate criteria.

(6) Any waiver granted by the director under subsection (3) of this section is: (a) In effect for a specified period of time, not to exceed two years. The mortgage insurer may request an extension of the waiver for a period not exceeding two additional years, and the director shall review the extension request based upon the factors set forth in subsection (4) of this section. (b) Subject to any terms and conditions that the director considers necessary to restore the mortgage insurers policyholders position to 25 or lower as required by subsection (2) of this section. (7) The director may adopt rules to carry out the provisions of this section.

      "text": "Conditions that insurers assuming ceded reinsurance must meet for allowance of credit; list of reciprocal jurisdictions; list of qualifying assuming insurers; rules. (1) Credit must be allowed if reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that meets each of the conditions set forth below: (a) The assuming insurer must be licensed in a reciprocal jurisdiction and have the assuming insurers home office in, or be domiciled in, as applicable, the reciprocal jurisdiction. For purposes of this paragraph, a reciprocal jurisdiction is a jurisdiction that meets one of the following: (A) A jurisdiction outside the United States that is subject to an in-force covered agreement with the United States, each within the jurisdictions legal authority or, in the case of a covered agreement between the United States and the European Union, is a member state of the European Union. For purposes of this subparagraph, a covered agreement is an agreement entered into under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 31 U.S.C. 313 and 314, that is currently in effect or in a period of provisional application and that addresses the elimination, under specified conditions, of collateral requirements as a condition for entering into any reinsurance agreement with a ceding insurer domiciled in this state or for allowing the ceding insurer to recognize credit for reinsurance. (B) A United States jurisdiction that meets the requirements for accreditation under the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Financial Regulation Standards and Accreditation Program. (C) A qualified jurisdiction, as the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services determines in accordance with ORS 731.511 (5), that is not otherwise described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph and that meets other requirements the director specifies by rule that are consistent with the terms and conditions of in-force covered agreements. (b) The assuming insurer must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus, or an equivalent, calculated according to the methodology of the assuming insurers domiciliary jurisdiction, in an amount set forth in rule. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, the assuming insurer must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, calculated according to the methodology applicable in the assuming insurers domiciliary jurisdiction, and a central fund containing a balance in amounts set forth in rule. (c) The assuming insurer must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio, as applicable, that is set forth in rule. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, the assuming insurer must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio in the reciprocal jurisdiction where the assuming insurer is licensed and has the assuming insurers head office or is domiciled. (d) The assuming insurer must agree and provide adequate assurance to the director, in a form the director specifies by rule, as follows: (A) The assuming insurer must provide prompt written notice and explanation to the director if the assuming insurer falls below the minimum requirements set forth in paragraph (b) or (c) of this subsection or if any regulatory action is taken against the assuming insurer for serious noncompliance with applicable law. (B) The assuming insurer must consent in writing to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state and to the appointment of the director as agent for service of process. The director may require that consent for service of process be provided to the director and included in each reinsurance agreement. This subparagraph does not limit or in any way alter the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, except to the extent that such agreements are unenforceable under applicable insolvency or delinquency laws. (C) Wherever enforcement is sought, the assuming insurer must consent in writing to pay all final judgments that a ceding insurer or the ceding insurers successor obtains in a jurisdiction that has declared the final judgment enforceable. (D) Each reinsurance agreement must include a provision requiring the assuming insurer to provide security in an amount equal to 100 percent of the assuming insurers liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded under the reinsurance agreement if the assuming insurer resists enforcement of a final judgment that is enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction in which the final judgment was obtained or of a properly enforceable arbitration award, whether the ceding insurer or the ceding insurers legal successor obtains the final judgment or arbitration award on behalf of the ceding insurer or the ceding insurers resolution estate. (E) The assuming insurer must confirm that the assuming insurer is not presently participating in any solvent scheme of arrangement that involves this states ceding insurers and, if the assuming insurer does enter into a solvent scheme of arrangement, must agree to notify the ceding insurer and the director and provide security in an amount equal to 100 percent of the assuming insurers liabilities to the ceding insurer. The security must be in a form that the director specifies by rule consistent with the provisions of ORS 731.510 and",

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, each authorized insurer doing business in this state shall pay assessments that the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services determines are necessary to support the legislatively authorized budget of the Department of Consumer and Business Services with respect to functions of the department under the Insurance Code. The director shall determine the assessments according to one or more percentage rates established by the director by rule. The director shall specify in the rule when assessments shall be made and payments shall be due. The premium-weighted average of the percentage rates may not exceed nine-hundredths of one percent of the gross amount of premiums received by an insurer or the insurers insurance producers from and under the insurers policies covering direct domestic risks, after deducting the amount of return premiums paid and the amount of dividend payments made to policyholders with respect to such policies. In the case of reciprocal insurers, the amount of savings paid or credited to the accounts of subscribers shall be deducted from the gross amount of premiums. In establishing the percentage rate or rates, the director shall use the most recent premium data approved by the director. In establishing the amounts to be collected under this subsection, the director shall take into consideration the expenses of the department for administering the Insurance Code and the fees collected under subsection (2) of this section. When the director establishes two or more percentage rates: (a) Each rate shall be based on such expenses of the department ascribed by the director to the line of insurance for which the rate is established. (b) Each rate shall be applied to the gross amount of premium received by an insurer or its insurance producers for the applicable line of insurance as provided in this subsection. (2) The director may collect fees for specific services provided by the department under the Insurance Code according to a schedule of fees established by the director by rule. The director may collect such fees in advance. In establishing the schedule for fees, the director shall take into consideration the cost of each service for which a fee is imposed. (3)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 743A.067 (7)(e) and 743A.067 (9), for the purpose of mitigating inequity in the health insurance market, the director may assess a fee on any insurer that offers a health benefit plan, as defined in ORS 743B.005, that is exempt from a provision of ORS chapter 743A or other provision of the Insurance Code that requires specified coverage by health benefit plans. (b) Any fees collected under paragraph (a) of this subsection must be the actuarial equivalent of costs attributed to the provision and administration of the required coverage by an insurer that is not exempt. (c) Nothing in this section limits the authority of the director to enforce the provisions of ORS chapter 743A if an insurer unlawfully fails to comply. (d) Notwithstanding ORS 646A.628, fees paid in accordance with paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be deposited in the General Fund to become available for general governmental expenses. (4) Establishment and amendment of the schedule of fees under subsection (2) of this section are subject to prior approval of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services and shall be within the budget authorized by the Legislative Assembly as that budget may be modified by the Emergency Board. (5) The director may not collect an assessment under subsection (1) of this section from any of the following persons: (a) A fraternal benefit society complying with ORS chapter 748. (b) Any person or class of persons designated by the director by rule. (6) The director may not collect an assessment under subsection (1) of this section with respect to premiums received from any of the following policies: (a) Workers compensation insurance policies. (b) Wet marine and transportation insurance policies. (c) Any category of policies designated by the director by rule.",

(b) Ascertain the proportion that the average annual premiums of the authorized insurer from wet marine and transportation insurance written by the authorized insurer in this state during the last preceding three calendar years bears to the average total of wet marine and transportation insurance premiums of the authorized insurer during the same three years. (c) Pay five percent on this proportion of the average annual underwriting profit of the authorized insurer from wet marine and transportation insurance to the director as a tax upon the insurance written by the authorized insurer in this state during the current calendar year.

At the expiration of each current calendar year, the profit or loss on wet marine and transportation insurance business of that year is to be added or deducted, and the profit or loss upon the insurance business of the first calendar year of the preceding three-year period is to be dropped so that the computation of underwriting profit for purposes of taxation under this section will always be on a three-year average.

(2) Each producer of nonadmitted wet marine and transportation insurance shall file with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, in accordance with the directors prescription, a verified report of any Oregon home state risk nonadmitted wet marine and transportation insurance the producer transacted during the previous 90 days and shall accompany the report with payment of the tax due on each transaction.

(3) The director may require insurance producers to file the report described in subsection (2) of this section on a form the director specifies or on a form that the Surplus Line Association of Oregon prescribes. If the director specifies that a producer must file the report on a Surplus Line Association of Oregon form, the association shall file the report with the director.

(5) The director by rule may establish requirements for filing reports on nonadmitted wet marine and transportation insurance transacted outside this state on Oregon home state risks for the purpose of collecting taxes on insurance that covers Oregon home state risks that is placed outside this state. (6) The director may collect taxes on 100 percent of the gross amount of premiums on Oregon home state risks for the purposes of carrying out the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-203, Title V, Subtitle B).
