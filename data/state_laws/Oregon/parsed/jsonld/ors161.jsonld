(2) Voluntary act means a bodily movement performed consciously and includes the conscious possession or control of property. (3) Omission means a failure to perform an act the performance of which is required by law. (4) Conduct means an act or omission and its accompanying mental state. (5) To act means either to perform an act or to omit to perform an act. (6) Culpable mental state means intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence as these terms are defined in subsections (7), (8), (9) and (10) of this section. (7) Intentionally or with intent, when used with respect to a result or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense, means that a person acts with a conscious objective to cause the result or to engage in the conduct so described. (8) Knowingly or with knowledge, when used with respect to conduct or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense, means that a person acts with an awareness that the conduct of the person is of a nature so described or that a circumstance so described exists. (9) Recklessly, when used with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense, means that a person is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation. (10) Criminal negligence or criminally negligent, when used with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense, means that a person fails to be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that the failure to be aware of it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.

(1)(a) When a person is conditionally released under ORS 161.315 to 161.351, the person is subject to those supervisory orders of the Psychiatric Security Review Board as are in the best interests of justice, the protection of society and the welfare of the person. (b) An order of conditional release entered by the board may designate any person or state, county or local agency capable of supervising the person upon release, subject to the conditions described in the order of conditional release. (c) Prior to the designation, the board shall notify the person or state, county or local agency to whom conditional release is contemplated and provide the person or state, county or local agency an opportunity to be heard. (d) After receiving an order entered under this section, the person or state, county or local agency designated in the order shall assume supervision of the person in accordance with the conditions described in the order and any modifications of the conditions ordered by the board. (2) Conditions of release contained in orders entered under this section may be modified from time to time and conditional releases may be terminated as provided in ORS 161.351. (3)(a) As a condition of release, the person may be required to report to any state or local mental health facility for evaluation. Whenever medical, psychiatric or psychological treatment is recommended, the order may require the person, as a condition of release, to cooperate with and accept the treatment from the facility. (b) The facility to which the person has been referred for evaluation shall perform the evaluation and submit a written report of its findings to the board. If the facility finds that treatment of the person is appropriate, it shall include its recommendations for treatment in the report to the board. (c) Whenever treatment is provided by the facility, it shall furnish reports to the board on a regular basis concerning the progress of the person. (d) Copies of all reports submitted to the board pursuant to this section shall be furnished to the person and the persons counsel. The confidentiality of these reports is determined pursuant to ORS 192.338, 192.345 and 192.355. (e) The facility shall comply with the conditional release order and any modifications of the conditions ordered by the board. (4)(a)(A) A written or electronic order for the return of a person on conditional release to a state hospital or other facility designated by the supervising entity or, if the person is under 18 years of age, to a secure intensive community inpatient facility or other facility designated by the supervising entity, may be issued by: (i) The supervising entity; (ii) A person designated by the supervising entity, if the designation is made as part of a written policy; or (iii) The community mental health program director, if the person has absconded from conditional release. (B) An order described in this paragraph may be issued when the supervising entity, the authorized designee or, if the person has absconded, the community mental health program director, has determined that: (i) The person has violated the terms of conditional release; or (ii) The mental health of the person has changed such that the supervising entity, or, if applicable, the authorized designee or the community mental health program director, reasonably believes that the person may no longer be fit for conditional release. (C) A written order under this paragraph is sufficient warrant for any law enforcement officer to take into custody and transport the person named in the order. A peace officer shall execute the order and the person shall be transported as described in paragraph (c) of this subsection. (b) A peace officer, the director of the facility providing treatment to a person on conditional release or any person responsible for the supervision of a person on conditional release may take a person on conditional release into custody, or request that the person be taken into custody, if there is reasonable cause to believe the person is a substantial danger to others because of a mental disorder and that the person is in need of immediate care, custody or treatment. (c) When a person is taken into custody by a peace officer under this subsection, the agency employing the peace officer shall cause the person, as soon as practicable, to be transported to a state hospital or other facility designated by the supervising entity. If the person was taken into custody pursuant to an order described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the supervising entity shall facilitate the reimbursement of reasonable costs of the transport to the agency employing the peace officer. (d) Within 20 days following the return of the person to a state hospital or secure intensive community inpatient facility under this subsection, the board shall conduct a hearing. The board shall provide notice of the hearing to the person, the attorney representing the person and the Attorney General. The state must prove by a preponderance of the evidence the persons unfitness for conditional release. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with ORS 161.346. (e) As used in this subsection, supervising entity means the board or the chairperson or executive director of the board. (5)(a) Any person conditionally released under this section may apply to the board for discharge from or modification of an order of conditional release on the ground that the person is no longer affected by a qualifying mental disorder or, if still so affected, no longer presents a substantial danger to others and no longer requires supervision, medication, care or treatment. Notice of the hearing on an application for discharge or modification of an order of conditional release shall be made to the Attorney General. The applicant, at the hearing pursuant to this subsection, must prove by a preponderance of the evidence the applicants fitness for discharge or modification of the order of conditional release. Applications by the person for discharge or modification of conditional release may not be filed more often than once every six months. (b) Upon application by any person or agency responsible for supervision or treatment pursuant to an order of conditional release, the board shall conduct a hearing to determine if the conditions of release shall be continued, modified or terminated. The application shall be accompanied by a report setting forth the facts supporting the application. (6) A person who has spent five years on conditional release shall be brought before the board for hearing within 30 days before the expiration of the five-year period. The board shall review the persons status and determine whether the person should be discharged from the jurisdiction of the board.",

(1) If at any time after a person is committed under ORS 161.315 to 161.351 to a state hospital or a secure intensive community inpatient facility, the superintendent of the hospital or the director of the secure intensive community inpatient facility is of the opinion that the person is no longer affected by a qualifying mental disorder, or, if so affected, no longer presents a substantial danger to others or that the person continues to be affected by a qualifying mental disorder and continues to be a danger to others, but that the person can be controlled with proper care, medication, supervision and treatment if conditionally released, the superintendent or director shall apply to the Psychiatric Security Review Board for an order of discharge or conditional release. The application shall be accompanied by a report setting forth the facts supporting the opinion of the superintendent or director. If the application is for conditional release, the application must be accompanied by a verified conditional release plan. The board shall hold a hearing on the application within 60 days of its receipt. Not less than 20 days prior to the hearing before the board, copies of the report shall be sent to the Attorney General. (2) The attorney representing the state may choose a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist to examine the person prior to the initial or any later decision by the board on discharge or conditional release. The results of the examination shall be in writing and filed with the board, and shall include, but need not be limited to, an opinion as to the mental condition of the person, whether the person presents a substantial danger to others and whether the person could be adequately controlled with treatment as a condition of release. (3) Any person who has been committed to a state hospital, or to a secure intensive community inpatient facility, for custody, care and treatment under ORS 161.315 to 161.351, or another person acting on the persons behalf, may apply to the board for an order of discharge or conditional release upon the grounds: (a) That the person is no longer affected by a qualifying mental disorder; (b) That the person, if so affected, no longer presents a substantial danger to others; or (c) That the person continues to be affected by a qualifying mental disorder and would continue to be a danger to others without treatment, but that the person can be adequately controlled and given proper care and treatment if placed on conditional release. (4) When application is made under subsection (3) of this section, the board shall require that a report from the superintendent of the hospital or the director of the secure intensive community inpatient facility be prepared and transmitted as provided in subsection (1) of this section. The applicant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence the applicants fitness for discharge or conditional release under the standards of subsection (3) of this section, unless more than two years has passed since the state had the burden of proof on that issue, in which case the state shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the applicants lack of fitness for discharge or conditional release. Applications for discharge or conditional release under subsection (3) of this section may not be filed more often than once every six months commencing with the date of the initial board hearing. (5) The board is not required to hold a hearing on a first application under subsection (3) of this section any sooner than 90 days after the initial hearing. Hearings resulting from any subsequent requests shall be held within 60 days of the filing of the application. (6)(a) In no case shall a person committed by the court under ORS 161.327 to a state hospital, or to a secure intensive community inpatient facility, be held in the hospital or facility for more than 90 days from the date of the courts commitment order without an initial hearing before the board to determine whether the person should be conditionally released or discharged. (b) In no case shall a person be held pursuant to this section for a period of time exceeding two years without a hearing before the board to determine whether the person should be conditionally released or discharged.",

      "text": "(d) If the court, while considering or ordering an appropriate action under this subsection, does not order the defendant committed to a state mental hospital or other facility, but finds that appropriate community restoration services are not present and available in the community, for any defendant remaining in custody after such determination, the court shall set a review hearing seven days from the date of the determination under paragraph (a) of this subsection. At the review hearing, the court shall consider all relevant information and determine if commitment to the state mental hospital or other facility is appropriate under subsection (3) or (4) of this section, or if another action described in paragraph (c) of this subsection is appropriate. At the conclusion of the hearing the court shall enter an order in accordance with the defendants constitutional rights to due process. (e) If the court determines that the appropriate action in the case is an order for the defendant to engage in community restoration services, but the defendant has a pending criminal case, warrant or hold in one or more other jurisdictions, the other jurisdictions shall, within two judicial days of becoming aware of the proceeding under this section, communicate with the court and the other jurisdictions, if applicable, to develop a plan to address the interests of all jurisdictions in the defendant in a timely manner. (3)(a) If the most serious offense in the charging instrument is a felony, the court shall commit the defendant to the custody of the superintendent of a state mental hospital or director of a facility designated by the Oregon Health Authority if the defendant is at least 18 years of age, or to the custody of the director of a secure intensive community inpatient facility designated by the authority if the defendant is under 18 years of age, if the court makes the following findings: (A) The defendant requires a hospital level of care due to public safety concerns if the defendant is not hospitalized or in custody or the acuity of symptoms of the defendants qualifying mental disorder; and (B) Based on the findings resulting from a consultation described in ORS 161.365 (1), if applicable, from any information provided by community-based mental health providers or any other sources, and primary and secondary release criteria as defined in ORS 135.230, the appropriate community restoration services are not present and available in the community. (b) If the defendant is committed under this subsection, the community mental health program director, or directors designee, shall at regular intervals, during any period of commitment, review available community restoration services and maintain communication with the defendant and the superintendent of the state mental hospital or director of the facility in order to facilitate an efficient transition to treatment in the community when ordered. (c) If the court does not order the commitment of the defendant under this subsection, the court shall proceed in accordance with subsection (2)(c) of this section to determine and order an appropriate action other than commitment. (4)(a) If the most serious offense in the charging instrument is a misdemeanor, the court may not commit the defendant to the custody of the superintendent of a state mental hospital or director of a facility designated by the Oregon Health Authority if the defendant is at least 18 years of age, or to the custody of the director of a secure intensive community inpatient facility designated by the authority if the defendant is under 18 years of age, unless the court: (A)(i) Receives a recommendation from a certified evaluator that the defendant requires a hospital level of care due to the acuity of symptoms of the defendants qualifying mental disorder; and (ii) Receives a recommendation from a community mental health program director, or directors designee, that the appropriate community restoration services are not present and available in the community; or (B) Determines that the defendant requires a hospital level of care after making all of the following written findings: (i) The defendant needs a hospital level of care due to the acuity of the symptoms of the defendants qualifying mental disorder; (ii) There are public safety concerns; and (iii) The appropriate community restoration services are not present and available in the community. (b) If at the time of determining the appropriate action for the case, the court is considering commitment under paragraph (a)(A) of this subsection and: (A) Has not received a recommendation from a certified evaluator as to whether the defendant requires a hospital level of care due to the acuity of symptoms of the defendants qualifying mental disorder, the court shall order a certified evaluator to make such a recommendation. (B) Has not received a recommendation from the community mental health program director or designee concerning whether appropriate community restoration services are present and available in the community, the court shall order the director or designee to make such a recommendation. (c) If the court does not order the commitment of the defendant under this subsection, the court shall proceed in accordance with subsection (2)(c) of this section to determine and order an appropriate action other than commitment. (d) If the defendant is committed under this subsection, the community mental health program director, or directors designee, shall at regular intervals, during any period of commitment, review available community restoration services and maintain communication with the defendant and the superintendent of the state mental hospital or director of the facility in order to facilitate an efficient transition to treatment in the community when ordered. (5) If the most serious offense in the charging instrument is a violation, the court may not commit the defendant to the custody of the superintendent of a state mental hospital or director of a facility designated by the Oregon Health Authority if the defendant is at least 18 years of age, or to the custody of the director of a secure intensive community inpatient facility designated by the authority if the defendant is under 18 years of age. (6)(a) If the court does not order the commitment of the defendant under subsection (3) or (4) of this section, if commitment is precluded under subsection (5) of this section or if the court determines that care other than commitment would better serve the defendant and the community, the court shall release the defendant, pursuant to an order that the defendant engage in community restoration services, until the defendant has gained or regained fitness to proceed, or until the court finds there is no substantial probability that the defendant will, within the foreseeable future, gain or regain fitness to proceed. The court may not order the defendant to engage in community restoration services in another county without permission from the other county. (b) The court may order a community mental health program director coordinating the defendants treatment in the community to provide the court with status reports on the defendants progress in gaining or regaining fitness to proceed. The director shall provide a status report if the defendant is not complying with court-ordered restoration services. (c) A community mental health program director coordinating the defendants treatment in the community shall notify the court if the defendant gains or regains fitness to proceed. The notice shall be filed with the court and may be filed electronically. The clerk of the court shall cause copies of the notice to be delivered to both the district attorney and the counsel for the defendant. (d) When a defendant is ordered to engage in community restoration services under this subsection, the court may place conditions that the court deems appropriate on the release, including the requirement that the defendant regularly report to a state mental hospital or a certified evaluator for examination to determine if the defendant has gained or regained fitness to proceed. (7) The Oregon Health Authority shall establish by rule standards for the recommendation provided to the court described in subsection (2) of this section.",

(1) The superintendent of a state mental hospital or director of a facility to which the defendant is committed under ORS 161.370 shall cause the defendant to be evaluated within 60 days from the defendants delivery into the superintendents or directors custody, for the purpose of determining whether there is a substantial probability that, in the foreseeable future, the defendant will have fitness to proceed. In addition, the superintendent or director shall: (a) Immediately notify the committing court if the defendant, at any time, gains or regains fitness to proceed or if there is no substantial probability that, within the foreseeable future, the defendant will gain or regain fitness to proceed. (b) Within 90 days of the defendants delivery into the superintendents or directors custody, notify the committing court that: (A) The defendant has present fitness to proceed; (B) There is no substantial probability that, in the foreseeable future, the defendant will gain or regain fitness to proceed; or (C) There is a substantial probability that, in the foreseeable future, the defendant will gain or regain fitness to proceed. If the probability exists, the superintendent or director shall give the court an estimate of the time in which the defendant, with appropriate treatment, is expected to gain or regain fitness to proceed. (c) Notify the court if court-ordered involuntary medication is necessary for the defendant to gain or regain fitness to proceed and, if appropriate, submit a report to the court under ORS 161.372. (2)(a) If the superintendent of the state mental hospital or director of the facility to which the defendant is committed determines that there is a substantial probability that, in the foreseeable future, the defendant will gain or regain fitness to proceed, unless the court otherwise orders, the defendant shall remain in the superintendents or directors custody where the defendant shall receive treatment designed for the purpose of enabling the defendant to gain or regain fitness to proceed. In keeping with the notice requirement under subsection (1)(b) of this section, the superintendent or director shall, for the duration of the defendants period of commitment, submit a progress report to the committing court, concerning the defendants fitness to proceed, at least once every 180 days as measured from the date of the defendants delivery into the superintendents or directors custody. (b) A progress report described in paragraph (a) of this subsection may consist of an update to: (A) The original examination report conducted under ORS 161.365; or (B) An evaluation conducted under subsection (1) of this section, if the defendant did not receive an examination under ORS 161.365. (3)(a) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, if the most serious offense in the charging instrument is a felony, and the superintendent of the state mental hospital or director of the facility to which the defendant is committed determines that a hospital level of care is no longer necessary due to present public safety concerns and the acuity of symptoms of the defendants qualifying mental disorder, the superintendent or director may file notice of the determination with the court. Upon receipt of the notice, the court shall order that a community mental health program director or the directors designee, within five judicial days: (A) Consult with the defendant and with any local entity that would be responsible for providing community restoration services, if the defendant were to be released in the community, to determine whether community restoration services are present and available in the community; and (B) Provide the court and the parties with recommendations from the consultation. (b) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, if the most serious offense in the charging instrument is a felony, and the community mental health program director determines that community restoration services that would mitigate any risk posed by the defendant are present and available in the community, the community mental health program director may file notice of the determination with the court. Upon receipt of the notice, the court shall order that the superintendent of the state mental hospital or director of the facility to which the defendant is committed, within five judicial days: (A) Evaluate the defendant to determine whether a hospital level of care is no longer necessary due to present public safety concerns, or no longer necessary due to the acuity of symptoms of the defendants qualifying mental disorder; and (B) Provide the court and the parties with recommendations from the evaluation. (c) Within 10 judicial days of receiving the recommendations described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection, the court shall hold a hearing to determine an appropriate action in accordance with ORS 161.370 (2)(c) as follows: (A) If, after consideration of the factors and possible actions described in ORS",

(2) The report described in subsection (1) of this section shall include: (a) Information regarding the benefits and side effects of each recommended medication; (b) Information concerning the defendants refusal to take the recommended medication; and (c) The likelihood that the medication will allow the defendant to gain or regain fitness to proceed. (3)(a) Based upon the report described in subsection (1) of this section, the prosecuting attorney may file a motion requesting that the court authorize the involuntary administration of medication to the defendant. The prosecuting attorney shall provide a copy of the motion to the defendant. (b) The court shall hold a hearing on the motion if either the prosecuting attorney or the defendant requests a hearing. At the hearing, the court shall determine whether to issue an order authorizing the involuntary administration of medication to the defendant. (c) In order to enter an order authorizing the involuntary administration of medication to the defendant, the court must find that: (A) Involuntary medication of the defendant is not otherwise authorized by law; (B) There are important state interests at stake in the prosecution of the defendant; (C) The recommended medication will significantly further the important state interests because: (i) It is substantially likely that the medication will render the defendant fit to proceed; and (ii) It is substantially unlikely that the medication will cause side effects that will impair the fairness of the criminal proceeding; (D) Involuntary administration of medication is necessary to further the important state interests because there are no alternative, less intrusive treatments that would produce the same result as the medication; and (E) Administration of the medication is medically appropriate because it is in the defendants best medical interest in light of the defendants medical condition. (d) A court order authorizing the involuntary administration of medication to a defendant under this section must specify: (A) The specific medication or type of medications permitted to be administered to the defendant; (B) The maximum dosage that may be administered; and (C) The duration of time that the state mental hospital may involuntarily medicate the defendant before reporting back to the court on the defendants mental condition and progress toward gaining or regaining fitness to proceed. The duration of time shall not exceed the maximum period of the defendants commitment to the state mental hospital, or 180 calendar days, whichever is shorter.

(b) Any facility in which a defendant is housed may not use a report or document described in paragraph (a) of this subsection to support a disciplinary action against the defendant. (c) Nothing in this subsection prohibits the prosecuting attorney, defense attorney or agent of the prosecuting or defense attorney from discussing the contents of a report or document described in paragraph (a) of this subsection with witnesses or victims as otherwise permitted by law.",

The election must be made by the district attorney orally or in writing at the time of the first appearance of the defendant. If a district attorney elects to treat a Class C felony or a violation of ORS 475.752 (7)(b), 475.854 (2)(c) or 475.874 (2)(c) as a Class A misdemeanor under this subsection, the court shall amend the accusatory instrument to reflect the charged offense as a Class A misdemeanor. (3) If, at some time after the first appearance of a defendant charged with a Class C nonperson felony or a violation of ORS 475.752 (7)(b), 475.854 (2)(c) or 475.874 (2)(c), the district attorney and the defendant agree to treat the charged offense as a Class A misdemeanor, the court may allow the offense to be treated as a Class A misdemeanor by stipulation of the parties. (4) If a Class C felony or a violation of ORS 475.752 (7)(b), 475.854 (2)(c) or 475.874 (2)(c) is treated as a Class A misdemeanor under this section, the court shall clearly denominate the offense as a Class A misdemeanor in any judgment entered in the matter. (5) If no election or stipulation is made under this section, the case proceeds as a felony. (6) Before a district attorney may make an election under subsection (2) of this section, the district attorney shall adopt written guidelines for determining when and under what circumstances the election may be made. The district attorney shall apply the guidelines uniformly. (7) Notwithstanding ORS 161.635, the fine that a court may impose upon conviction of a misdemeanor under this section may not: (a) Be less than the minimum fine established by ORS 137.286 for a felony; or (b) Exceed the amount provided in ORS 161.625 for the class of felony receiving Class A misdemeanor treatment.",

(1) As used in this section, firearm has the meaning given that term in ORS 166.210. (2) The use or threatened use of a firearm, whether operable or inoperable, by a defendant during the commission of a felony may be pleaded in the accusatory instrument and proved at trial as an element in aggravation of the crime as provided in this section. When a crime is so pleaded, the aggravated nature of the crime may be indicated by adding the words with a firearm to the title of the offense. The unaggravated crime shall be considered a lesser included offense. (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 161.605 or 137.010 (3) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (6) of this section, if a defendant is convicted of a felony having as an element the defendants use or threatened use of a firearm during the commission of the crime, the court shall impose at least the minimum term of imprisonment as provided in subsection (4) of this section. Except as provided in ORS 144.122 and 144.126 and subsection (5) of this section, in no case shall any person punishable under this section become eligible for work release, parole, temporary leave or terminal leave until the minimum term of imprisonment is served, less a period of time equivalent to any reduction of imprisonment granted for good time served or time credits earned under ORS 421.121, nor shall the execution of the sentence imposed upon such person be suspended by the court. (4) The minimum terms of imprisonment for felonies having as an element the defendants use or threatened use of a firearm in the commission of the crime shall be as follows: (a) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, upon the first conviction for such felony, five years, except that if the firearm is a machine gun, short-barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun or is equipped with a firearms silencer, the term of imprisonment shall be 10 years. (b) Upon conviction for such felony committed after punishment pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection or subsection (5) of this section, 10 years, except that if the firearm is a machine gun, short-barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun or is equipped with a firearms silencer, the term of imprisonment shall be 20 years. (c) Upon conviction for such felony committed after imprisonment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection, 30 years. (5) If it is the first time that the defendant is subject to punishment under this section, rather than impose the sentence otherwise required by subsection (4)(a) of this section, the court may: (a) For felonies committed prior to November 1, 1989, suspend the execution of the sentence or impose a lesser term of imprisonment, when the court expressly finds mitigating circumstances justifying such lesser sentence and sets forth those circumstances in its statement on sentencing; or (b) For felonies committed on or after November 1, 1989, impose a lesser sentence in accordance with the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission. (6) When a defendant who is convicted of a felony having as an element the defendants use or threatened use of a firearm during the commission of the crime is a person who was waived under ORS 137.707 (5)(b)(A), 419C.349 (1)(b), 419C.352, 419C.364 or 419C.370, the court is not required to impose a minimum term of imprisonment under this section.",

Costs include a reasonable attorney fee for counsel appointed pursuant to ORS 135.045 or 135.050 and a reasonable amount for fees and expenses incurred pursuant to preauthorization under ORS 135.055. A reasonable attorney fee is presumed to be a reasonable number of hours at the hourly rate authorized by the Oregon Public Defense Commission under ORS 151.216. Costs do not include expenses inherent in providing a constitutionally guaranteed jury trial or expenditures in connection with the maintenance and operation of government agencies that must be made by the public irrespective of specific violations of law. (2) Except as provided in ORS 151.505, the court, after the conclusion of an appeal of its initial judgment of conviction, may include in its general judgment, or enter a supplemental judgment that includes, a money award that requires a convicted defendant to pay a reasonable attorney fee for counsel appointed pursuant to ORS 138.500, including counsel who is appointed under ORS 151.216 or counsel who is under contract to provide services for the proceeding under ORS 151.219, and other costs and expenses allowed by the executive director of the Oregon Public Defense Commission under ORS 138.500 (4). A reasonable attorney fee is presumed to be a reasonable number of hours at the hourly rate authorized by the commission under ORS 151.216. (3) For purposes of subsections (1) and (2) of this section, compensation of counsel is determined by reference to a schedule of compensation established by the commission under ORS 151.216. (4) The court may not sentence a defendant to pay costs under this section unless the defendant is or may be able to pay them. In determining the amount and method of payment of costs, the court shall take account of the financial resources of the defendant and the nature of the burden that payment of costs will impose. (5) A defendant who has been sentenced to pay costs under this section and who is not in contumacious default in the payment of costs may at any time petition the court that sentenced the defendant for remission of the payment of costs or of any unpaid portion of costs. If it appears to the satisfaction of the court that payment of the amount due will impose manifest hardship on the defendant or the immediate family of the defendant, the court may enter a supplemental judgment that remits all or part of the amount due in costs, or modifies the method of payment under ORS 161.675. (6) Except as provided in subsection (7) of this section, all moneys collected or paid under this section shall be paid into the Criminal Fine Account. (7) The court may, in the judgment of conviction, include a money award requiring the defendant to pay the costs of extraditing the defendant to this state. Any amounts awarded to the state under this subsection must be listed separately in the money award portion of the judgment.

(1) When a defendant who has been sentenced or ordered to pay a fine, or to make restitution, defaults on a payment or installment ordered by the court, the court on motion of the district attorney or upon its own motion may require the defendant to show cause why the default should not be treated as contempt of court, and may issue a show cause citation or a warrant of arrest for the appearance of the defendant. (2) If the court finds that the default constitutes contempt, the court may impose one or more of the sanctions authorized by ORS 33.105. (3) When a fine or an order of restitution is imposed on a corporation or unincorporated association, it is the duty of the person authorized to make disbursement from the assets of the corporation or association to pay the fine or make the restitution from those assets, and if that person fails to do so, the court may hold that person in contempt. (4) Notwithstanding ORS 33.105, the term of confinement for contempt for nonpayment of fines or failure to make restitution shall be set forth in the commitment order, and shall not exceed one day for each $25 of the fine or restitution, 30 days if the fine or order of restitution was imposed upon conviction of a violation or misdemeanor, or one year in any other case, whichever is the shorter period. (5) If it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the default in the payment of a fine or restitution is not contempt, the court may enter an order allowing the defendant additional time for payment, reducing the amount of the payment or installments due on the payment, or revoking the fine or order of restitution in whole or in part. (6) A default in the payment of a fine or costs or failure to make restitution or a default on an installment on a fine, costs or restitution may be collected by any means authorized by law for the enforcement of a judgment. The levy of execution or garnishment for the collection of a fine or restitution shall not discharge a defendant confined for contempt until the amount of the fine or restitution has actually been collected. (7) The court, or the court clerk if ordered by the court, may report a default on a court-ordered payment to a consumer reporting agency. (8) The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall adopt rules under ORS 1.002 establishing policies and procedures for reporting a default under subsection (7) of this section to a consumer reporting agency that may include, but are not limited to, limitations on reporting a default to a consumer reporting agency. (9) Except as otherwise provided in this section, proceedings under this section shall be conducted: (a) As provided in ORS 33.055, if the court seeks to impose remedial sanctions as described in ORS 33.015 to 33.155; and (b) As provided in ORS 33.065, if the court seeks to impose punitive sanctions as described in ORS 33.015 to 33.155. (10) Confinement under this section may be custody or incarceration, whether actual or constructive. (11) As used in this section: (a) Consumer reporting agency means any person that regularly engages for fees, dues, or on a nonprofit basis, in whole or in part, in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties. (b) Restitution has the meaning given that term in ORS 137.103.

(1) Subject to the provisions of ORS 161.737, the maximum term of an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for a dangerous offender is 30 years, if because of the dangerousness of the defendant an extended period of confined correctional treatment or custody is required for the protection of the public and one or more of the following grounds exist: (a) The defendant is being sentenced for a Class A felony and the defendant is suffering from a severe personality disorder indicating a propensity toward crimes that seriously endanger the life or safety of another. (b) The defendant is being sentenced for a felony that seriously endangered the life or safety of another, the defendant has been previously convicted of a felony not related to the instant crime as a single criminal episode and the defendant is suffering from a severe personality disorder indicating a propensity toward crimes that seriously endanger the life or safety of another. (c) The defendant is being sentenced for a felony that seriously endangered the life or safety of another, the defendant has previously engaged in unlawful conduct not related to the instant crime as a single criminal episode that seriously endangered the life or safety of another and the defendant is suffering from a severe personality disorder indicating a propensity toward crimes that seriously endanger the life or safety of another. (2) As used in this section, previously convicted of a felony means: (a) Previous conviction of a felony in a court of this state; (b) Previous conviction in a court of the United States, other than a court-martial, of an offense which at the time of conviction of the offense was and at the time of conviction of the instant crime is punishable under the laws of the United States by death or by imprisonment in a penitentiary, prison or similar institution for a term of one year or more; or (c) Previous conviction by a general court-martial of the United States or in a court of any other state or territory of the United States, or of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, of an offense which at the time of conviction of the offense was punishable by death or by imprisonment in a penitentiary, prison or similar institution for a term of one year or more and which offense also at the time of conviction of the instant crime would have been a felony if committed in this state. (3) As used in this section, previous conviction of a felony does not include: (a) An offense committed when the defendant was less than 16 years of age; (b) A conviction rendered after the commission of the instant crime; (c) A conviction that is the defendants most recent conviction described in subsection (2) of this section, and the defendant was finally and unconditionally discharged from all resulting imprisonment, probation or parole more than seven years before the commission of the instant crime; or (d) A conviction that was by court-martial of an offense denounced only by military law and triable only by court-martial. (4) As used in this section, conviction means an adjudication of guilt upon a plea, verdict or finding in a criminal proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction, but does not include an adjudication which has been expunged by pardon, reversed, set aside or otherwise rendered nugatory.",

At the presentence hearing the district attorney and the defendant may question any psychiatrist or psychologist who examined the defendant pursuant to this section. (6) If, after considering the evidence in the case or in the presentence hearing, the jury or, if the defendant waives the right to a jury trial, the court finds that the defendant comes within ORS 161.725, the court may sentence the defendant as a dangerous offender. (7) In determining whether a defendant has been previously convicted of a felony for purposes of ORS 161.725, the court shall consider as prima facie evidence of the previous conviction: (a) A copy of the judicial record of the conviction which copy is authenticated under ORS 40.510; (b) A copy of the fingerprints of the subject of that conviction which copy is authenticated under ORS 40.510; and (c) Testimony that the fingerprints of the subject of that conviction are those of the defendant. (8) Subsection (7) of this section does not prohibit proof of the previous conviction by any other procedure. (9) The facts required to be found to sentence a defendant as a dangerous offender under this section are enhancement facts, as defined in ORS 136.760, and ORS 136.765 to 136.785 apply to making determinations of those facts.",

The findings made to classify the defendant as a dangerous offender under ORS 161.725 and 161.735 shall constitute substantial and compelling reasons to depart from the presumptive sentence as provided by rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission. (2) When the sentence is imposed, the sentencing judge shall indicate on the record the reasons for the departure and shall impose, in addition to the indeterminate sentence imposed under ORS 161.725, a required incarceration term that the offender must serve before release to post-prison supervision. If the presumptive sentence that would have been imposed if the court had not imposed the sentence under ORS 161.725 and 161.735 as a departure is a prison sentence, the required incarceration term shall be no less than the presumptive incarceration term and no more than twice the maximum presumptive incarceration term. If the presumptive sentence for the offense is probation, the required incarceration term shall be no less than the maximum incarceration term provided by the rule of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission that establishes incarceration terms for dispositional departures and no more than twice that amount. However, the indeterminate sentence imposed under this section and ORS 161.725 is not subject to any guideline rule establishing limitations on the duration of departures.",
