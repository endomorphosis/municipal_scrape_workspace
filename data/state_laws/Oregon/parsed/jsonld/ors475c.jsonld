The lien shall attach and become enforceable on the day of the filing described in this subsection. (b) A lien described in this subsection shall be foreclosed in the manner provided in ORS chapter 88. (c) A lien described in this subsection shall have priority over any claim of the state under ORS 166.715 to 166.735 or any local government forfeiture ordinance or regulation.

(b) Identifying appropriate tests for marijuana items and industrial hemp-derived vapor items, depending on the type of marijuana item or industrial hemp-derived vapor item and the manner in which the marijuana item or industrial hemp-derived vapor item was produced or processed, that are necessary to protect the public health and safety, including, but not limited to, tests for: (A) Microbiological contaminants; (B) Pesticides; (C) Other contaminants; (D) Solvents or residual solvents; and (E) Adult use cannabinoid and cannabidiol concentration. (c) Establishing procedures for determining batch sizes and for sampling usable marijuana, cannabinoid products, cannabinoid concentrates or extracts and industrial hemp-derived vapor items. (d) Establishing different minimum standards for different varieties of usable marijuana and different types of cannabinoid products and cannabinoid concentrates and extracts and, as appropriate, industrial hemp-derived vapor items. (2) In addition to the testing requirements established under subsection (1) of this section, the authority or the commission may require cannabinoid edibles to be tested in accordance with any applicable law of this state, or any applicable rule adopted under a law of this state, related to the production and processing of food products or commodities. (3) In adopting rules under ORS 475C.770 to 475C.919, the authority may require: (a) A person responsible for a marijuana grow site under ORS 475C.792 to test usable marijuana before transferring the usable marijuana to a registrant other than an individual who holds a registry identification card under ORS 475C.783; and (b) A person processing marijuana to test cannabinoid products or cannabinoid concentrates or extracts before transferring the cannabinoid products or cannabinoid concentrates or extracts to a registrant other than an individual who holds a registry identification card under ORS 475C.783. (4) In adopting rules under ORS 475C.005 to 475C.525, the commission may require: (a) A marijuana producer that holds a license under ORS 475C.065 or a marijuana wholesaler that holds a license under ORS 475C.093 to test usable marijuana before selling or transferring the usable marijuana; and (b) A marijuana processor that holds a license under ORS 475C.085 or a marijuana wholesaler that holds a license under ORS 475C.093 to test cannabinoid products or cannabinoid concentrates or extracts before selling or transferring the cannabinoid products or cannabinoid concentrates or extracts. (5) The authority and the commission may conduct testing of marijuana items or industrial hemp-derived vapor items for the purpose of determining whether a person subject to testing under subsection (3) of this section or a licensee subject to testing under subsection (4) of this section is in compliance with this section. (6) In adopting rules to implement this section, the authority and commission may not require a marijuana item or industrial hemp-derived vapor item to undergo the same test more than once unless: (a) The marijuana item or industrial hemp-derived vapor item is processed into a different type of marijuana item or industrial hemp-derived vapor item or the condition of the marijuana item or industrial hemp-derived vapor item has fundamentally changed; (b) The authority or the commission has reason to believe that the marijuana item or industrial hemp-derived vapor item is not in compliance with rules adopted under this section; or (c) The test to which the marijuana item or industrial hemp-derived vapor item is subject more than once is a test described in subsection (5) of this section. (7) The testing of marijuana items and industrial hemp-derived vapor items as required by this section must be conducted by a laboratory licensed by the commission under ORS 475C.548 and accredited by the authority under ORS",
