(1) The State of Oregon recognizes that providing and operating state government facilities is a significant capital investment in public infrastructure. Accordingly, it is the policy of the State of Oregon to plan, finance, acquire, construct, manage and maintain state government facilities in a manner that maximizes and protects this investment. (2) The Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall establish a statewide planning process that evaluates the needs of the states facilities, provides comparative information on the condition of the states facilities, establishes guidelines and standards for acquiring, managing and maintaining state facilities and provides financing and budgeting strategies to allocate resources to facilities needs. (3)(a) The Director of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services shall establish a public review process for the proposed capital projects of all state agencies. To assist in this review, the director shall establish a Capital Projects Advisory Board consisting of seven members. Five members shall be public members knowledgeable about construction, facilities management and maintenance issues. Two members may be state employees. The director shall appoint the chairperson of the board. (b) The director, in consultation with the board, may request that agencies submit updated long-range facility plans and funding strategies that reflect changes in technology and priorities. The director may ask the board to report on and make recommendations related to long-range plans, the condition of facilities, maintenance schedules, funding strategies and options for new facilities. The director may seek recommendations from the board regarding the needs of existing facilities, funding strategies and long-term facility goals. (c) The review process may be applicable to capital projects meeting the definition of major construction/acquisition in the Governors budget and to significant leases. (d) For each state agency proposing a capital project, the review process may include an examination of the following: (A) The effectiveness of asset protection, including maintenance, repair and other activities; (B) The effectiveness of space utilization, including an inventory of existing occupied and unoccupied building space; (C) The advisability of lease, purchase or other funding strategies; (D) The condition of existing occupied and unoccupied building space; (E) Appropriate technology; (F) The agencys mission and long-range facilities plans; and (G) For new facilities, expansions and additions, the ability of the agency to maintain and operate all of the agencys facilities in a cost-effective manner. (e) The review process shall ensure that capital project decisions are approached in a cost-effective manner after considering all reasonable alternatives. (f) With assistance from the board, the department shall provide recommendations and information to the Governor and the Legislative Assembly on the construction, leasing and facilities management issues of state government. (4) The department shall establish and maintain a central database of information on state-owned property of all state agencies, including land, buildings, infrastructure, improvements and leases. This database shall include an inventory of state-owned facilities as well as descriptive and technical information. (5) State agencies shall establish and implement long-range maintenance and management plans for facilities for which this state is responsible to ensure that facilities are maintained in good repair and that the useful lives of facilities are maximized. For each new facility, a maintenance and management plan appropriate to the use and useful life of the facility shall be developed and implemented. (6) The department may engage in cooperative projects with local government.

(1) It is the policy of the State of Oregon to facilitate and encourage state agencies that own real property and operate facilities to manage and develop these properties in an effective and businesslike manner. The maintenance, preservation and development of state-owned real property and facilities, including, but not limited to, educational institutions, hospitals, parks, roads, libraries and fish hatcheries is essential to enable the State of Oregon to meet the needs of its citizens now and in the future. The purpose of chapter 452, Oregon Laws 1995, is to maintain and protect the investment of the State of Oregon in its public infrastructure. (2) Any state agency that owns and operates real property or facilities is authorized to establish a separate dedicated account in the State Treasury for the purpose of paying the expenses of constructing, operating, maintaining, repairing, replacing, equipping, improving, acquiring and disposing of such real property and facilities. All moneys in an account established pursuant to this subsection are appropriated continuously to the agency for the purposes described in this subsection. All interest earned on moneys in the account shall be retained in and credited to the account. (3) Any state agency that owns or operates real property or facilities may establish a rental program for the purpose of recovering and paying for the costs, including debt service, of constructing, operating, maintaining, repairing, replacing, equipping, improving and disposing of real property and facilities consistent with the statutory authority of the state agency. All revenues from such rental programs shall be deposited in the account established pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. (4) Whenever a state agency that owns and operates real property and facilities, and that has an established account under subsection (2) of this section sells or leases real property, the proceeds from the sale or lease shall be credited to the account established pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, unless disposition of the proceeds is otherwise provided by law. (5) If a state agency that owns and operates real property and facilities has other statutory authority to provide funding for real property and facility operation and management, the agency may use that authority in lieu of or in addition to the provisions of this section. (6) When a state agency establishes an account pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, the agency shall provide a report of the revenues to and expenditures from the account as part of its budget submission to the Governor and the Legislative Assembly under ORS chapter 291.

(3) Subject to rules established by the department, and consistent with the policies under ORS 276.591, an agency may establish fees below the base rate, or provide reduced-cost or free parking: (a) For employees who have been issued a disabled person parking permit by the Department of Transportation and require the use of their vehicle in traveling to and from work; (b) For employees who have registered with and are participating in a carpool or vanpool; (c) For employees participating in a program which encourages the use of parking spaces in noncongested areas; (d) For motorcycles, bicycles and similar vehicles; (e) To reduce a public hardship to those transacting business with the state agency or using the state agency services, but not including state employees; or (f) Where conditions show that within the area there is no market or a reduced market for parking spaces. (4) The state agency that controls the parking facility retains funds collected under this section. Funds collected under this section must be first used to cover the costs of parking as provided under subsection (2)(a) of this section. Agencies are encouraged to use additional receipts obtained under this section to offer programs to incentivize employee carpooling, vanpooling, transit use or other alternative commuting to support the goals under ORS 276.591. (5) Subject to rules established by the department, an agency may establish fees in excess of the base rate for individually reserved parking spaces or parking spaces with greater desirability or quality. (6) The state agency may designate spaces within a parking facility that are not leased as available to the public as free or metered spaces. (7) Except as provided in this section, a state agency may not provide an employee with parking vouchers or reduced or free parking within a parking facility.

(1) An authorized state agency may construct or renovate a facility only if the authorized state agency determines that the design incorporates all reasonable cost-effective energy conservation measures and alternative energy systems. The determination by the authorized state agency shall include consideration of indoor air quality issues and operation and maintenance costs. (2) Whenever an authorized state agency determines that a major facility is to be constructed or renovated, the authorized state agency shall cause to be included in the design phase of the construction or renovation a provision that requires an energy consumption analysis to be prepared for the facility under the direction of a professional engineer or registered architect or under the direction of a person that is prequalified in accordance with this section. The authorized state agency and the State Department of Energy shall agree to the list of energy conservation measures and alternative energy systems that the energy consumption analysis will include. The energy consumption analysis and facility design shall be delivered to the State Department of Energy during the design development phase of the facility design. The State Department of Energy shall review the energy consumption analysis and forward its findings to the authorized state agency within 10 working days after receiving the energy consumption analysis, if practicable. (3) The State Department of Energy, in consultation with authorized state agencies, shall adopt rules to carry out the provisions of ORS 276.900 to 276.915. These rules shall: (a) Include a simplified and usable method for determining which energy conservation measures and alternative energy systems are cost-effective. The method shall reflect the energy costs of the utility serving the facility. (b) Prescribe procedures for determining if a facility design incorporates all reasonable cost-effective energy conservation measures and alternative energy systems. (c) Establish fees through which an authorized state agency will reimburse the State Department of Energy for the departments review of energy consumption analyses and facility designs and the departments reporting tasks. The fees imposed may not exceed 0.2 percent of the capital construction cost of the facility and must be included in the energy consumption analysis required in subsection (2) of this section. The State Department of Energy may provide for a waiver of fees and reviews if the authorized state agency demonstrates that the facility will be designed and constructed in a manner that incorporates only cost-effective energy conservation measures or in a manner that exceeds the energy conservation provisions of the state building code by 20 percent or more. (d) Periodically define highly efficient facilities. A facility constructed or renovated after June 30, 2001, shall exceed the energy conservation provisions of the state building code by 20 percent or more, unless otherwise required by rules adopted under this section. (e) Establish guidelines for implementing subsection (4) of this section. (f) Establish guidelines for incorporating energy efficiency requirements into lease agreements of 10 or more years to be phased in as current lease agreements expire or as new lease agreements are entered into, allowing reasonable time for the owner to implement the requirements of this section. (g) Establish criteria by which the State Department of Energy determines that a person is prequalified to perform work in accordance with this section. (4) Before June 30, 2015, an authorized state agency shall reduce the total amount of energy the authorized state agency uses in the authorized state agencys owned facilities by at least 20 percent from a baseline amount the State Department of Energy determines by rule based on usage in calendar year 2000. (5) An authorized state agency shall report annually to the State Department of Energy concerning energy use in the authorized state agencys facilities. The State Department of Energy shall specify by rule the form and content of and deadlines for the reports.
