      "text": "Duty of court to ascertain and impose punishment. (1) The statutes that define offenses impose a duty upon the court having jurisdiction to pass sentence in accordance with this section or, for felonies committed on or after November 1, 1989, in accordance with rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission unless otherwise specifically provided by law. (2) If it cannot be determined whether the felony was committed on or after November 1, 1989, the defendant shall be sentenced as if the felony had been committed prior to November 1, 1989. (3) Except when a person is convicted of a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989, if the court is of the opinion that it is in the best interests of the public as well as of the defendant, the court may suspend the imposition or execution of any part of a sentence for any period of not more than five years. The court may extend the period of suspension beyond five years in accordance with subsection (4) of this section. (4) If the court suspends the imposition or execution of a part of a sentence for an offense other than a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989, the court may also impose and execute a sentence of probation on the defendant for a definite or indefinite period of not more than five years. However, upon a later finding that a defendant sentenced to probation for a felony has violated a condition of the probation and in lieu of revocation, the court may order the period of both the suspended sentence and the sentence of probation extended until a date not more than six years from the date of original imposition of sentence. Time during which the probationer has absconded from supervision and a bench warrant has been issued for the probationers arrest shall not be counted in determining the time elapsed since imposition of the sentence of probation. (5) If the court announces that it intends to suspend imposition or execution of any part of a sentence, the defendant may, at that time, object and request imposition of the full sentence. In no case, however, does the defendant have a right to refuse the courts order, and the court may suspend imposition or execution of a part of the sentence despite the defendants objection or request. If the court further announces that it intends to sentence the defendant to a period of probation, the defendant may, at that time, object and request that a sentence of probation or its conditions not be imposed or that different conditions be imposed. In no case, however, does the defendant have the right to refuse a sentence of probation or any of the conditions of the probation, and the court may sentence the defendant to probation subject to conditions despite the defendants objection or request. (6) The power of the judge of any court to suspend execution of any part of a sentence or to sentence any person convicted of a crime to probation shall continue until the person is delivered to the custody of the Department of Corrections. (7) When a person is convicted of an offense and the court does not suspend the imposition or execution of any part of a sentence or when a suspended sentence or sentence of probation is revoked, the court shall impose the following sentence: (a) A term of imprisonment; (b) A fine; (c) Both imprisonment and a fine; or (d) Discharge of the defendant. (8) This section does not deprive the court of any authority conferred by law to enter a judgment for the forfeiture of property, suspend or cancel a license, remove a person from office or impose any other civil penalty. An order exercising that authority may be included as part of the judgment of conviction. (9) When imposing sentence for a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989, the court shall submit sentencing information to the commission in accordance with rules of the commission. (10) A judgment of conviction that includes a term of imprisonment for a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989, shall state the length of incarceration and the length of post-prison supervision. The judgment of conviction shall also provide that if the defendant violates the conditions of post-prison supervision, the defendant shall be subject to sanctions including the possibility of additional imprisonment in accordance with rules of the commission.",

(3) If the defendant is in custody following the verdict, the court shall pronounce judgment as soon as practicable, but in any case within seven calendar days following the verdict if no presentence investigation is ordered, and within seven calendar days after delivery of the presentence report to the court if a presentence investigation has been ordered; however, the court may delay pronouncement of judgment beyond the limits of this subsection for good cause shown. (4) If the final calendar day a defendant must be sentenced is not a judicial day then sentencing may be delayed until the next judicial day. (5)(a) At the time a court pronounces judgment the defendant, if present, shall be advised of the right to appeal and of the procedure for protecting that right. If the defendant is not present, the court shall advise the defendant in writing of the right to appeal and of the procedure for protecting that right. (b) If the trial court sentences the defendant subsequent to a plea of guilty or no contest or upon probation revocation or sentence suspension, or if the trial court sentences the defendant after judgment of an appellate court or a post-conviction relief court, the court shall advise the defendant of the limitations on reviewability imposed by ORS 138.105 in person or, if the defendant is not present, in writing. (6) If the defendant is financially eligible for appointment of counsel at state expense on appeal under ORS 138.500, trial counsel shall determine whether the defendant wishes to pursue an appeal. If the defendant wishes to pursue an appeal, trial counsel shall transmit to the Oregon Public Defense Commission, on a form prepared by the office, information necessary to perfect the appeal.",

In addition, a judgment document in a criminal action must: (a) Indicate whether the defendant was determined to be financially eligible for purposes of appointed counsel in the action. (b) Indicate whether the court appointed counsel for the defendant in the action. (c) If there is no attorney for the defendant, indicate whether the defendant knowingly waived any right to an attorney after having been informed of that right. (d) Include the identity of the recorder or reporter for the proceeding or action who is to be served under ORS 138.081. (e) Include any information specifically required by statute or by court rule. (f) Specify clearly the courts determination for each charge in the information, indictment or complaint. (g) Specify clearly the courts disposition, including all legal consequences the court establishes or imposes. If the determination is one of conviction, the judgment document must include any suspension of sentence, forfeiture, imprisonment, cancellation of license, removal from office, monetary obligation, probation, conditions of probation, discharge, restitution, community service and all other sentences and legal consequences imposed by the court. Nothing in this paragraph requires the judgment document to specify any consequences that may result from the determination but are not established or imposed by the court. (h) Include the identities of the attorney for the state and the attorney, if any, for the defendant. (i) If the court sentences the defendant to a term of incarceration, and the physical custody of the defendant as determined by ORS 137.124 is related to the age of the defendant at the time of committing an offense, indicate the age of the defendant at the time of committing the offense. (3) A judgment document in a criminal action that includes a money award, as defined in ORS 18.005, must comply with ORS 18.048. (4) The requirements of this section do not apply to a judgment document if the action was commenced by the issuance of a uniform citation adopted under ORS 1.525 and the court has used the space on the citation for the entry of a judgment. The exemption provided by this subsection does not apply if any indictment, information or complaint other than a uniform citation is filed in the action. (5) For the purposes of determining the defendants age at the time of committing an offense under subsection (2) of this section: (a) If the defendant is convicted of two or more offenses occurring on different days, the defendants age shall be calculated using the earliest date. (b) If the defendant is convicted of an offense occurring within a range of dates, the defendants age shall be calculated using the date at the beginning of the range.",

(1) This section applies to any person convicted of: (a) A felony; (b) Sexual abuse in the third degree or public indecency; (c) Conspiracy or attempt to commit rape in the third degree, sodomy in the third degree, sexual abuse in the second degree, burglary in the second degree or promoting prostitution; or (d) Murder or aggravated murder. (2) When a person is convicted of an offense listed in subsection (1) of this section: (a) The person shall, whether or not ordered to do so by the court under paragraph (b) of this subsection, provide a blood or buccal sample at the request of the appropriate agency designated in paragraph (c) of this subsection. (b) The court shall include in the judgment of conviction an order stating that a blood or buccal sample is required to be obtained at the request of the appropriate agency and, unless the convicted person lacks the ability to pay, that the person shall reimburse the appropriate agency for the cost of obtaining and transmitting the blood or buccal sample. If the judgment sentences the convicted person to probation, the court shall order the convicted person to submit to the obtaining of a blood or buccal sample as a condition of the probation. (c) The appropriate agency shall cause a blood or buccal sample to be obtained and transmitted to the Department of State Police. The agency shall cause the sample to be obtained as soon as practicable after conviction. The agency shall obtain the convicted persons thumbprint at the same time the agency obtains the blood or buccal sample. The agency shall include the thumbprint with the identifying information that accompanies the sample. Whenever an agency is notified by the Department of State Police that a sample is not adequate for analysis, the agency shall obtain and transmit a blood sample. The appropriate agency shall be: (A) The Department of Corrections, whenever the convicted person is committed to the legal and physical custody of the department. (B) In all other cases, the law enforcement agency attending upon the court. (3)(a) A blood sample may only be drawn in a medically acceptable manner by a licensed physician, a person acting under the direction or control of a licensed physician, a physician assistant licensed under ORS 677.505 to 677.525, a nurse licensed under ORS chapter 678 or a qualified medical technician. (b) A buccal sample may be obtained by anyone authorized to do so by the appropriate agency. The person obtaining the buccal sample shall follow the collection procedures established by the Department of State Police. (c) A person authorized by this subsection to obtain a blood or buccal sample shall not be held civilly liable for obtaining a sample in accordance with this subsection and subsection (2) of this section, ORS 161.325 and 419C.473. The sample shall also be obtained and transmitted in accordance with any procedures that may be established by the Department of State Police. However, no test result or opinion based upon a test result shall be rendered inadmissible as evidence solely because of deviations from procedures adopted by the Department of State Police that do not affect the reliability of the opinion or test result. (4) No sample is required to be obtained if: (a) The Department of State Police notifies the court or the appropriate agency that it has previously received an adequate blood or buccal sample obtained from the convicted person in accordance with this section or ORS 161.325 or 419C.473; or (b) The court determines that obtaining a sample would create a substantial and unreasonable risk to the health of the convicted person. (5) The provisions of subsections (1) to (4) of this section apply to any person who, on or after September 29, 1991, is serving a term of incarceration as a sentence or as a condition of probation imposed for conviction of an offense listed in subsection (1) of this section, and any such person shall submit to the obtaining of a blood or buccal sample.

      "text": "Restitution to victims; objections by defendant; disclosure to defendant. (1)(a) When a person is convicted of a crime, or a violation as described in ORS 153.008, that has resulted in economic damages, the district attorney shall investigate and present to the court, at the time of sentencing or as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, evidence of the nature and amount of the damages. (b)(A) If the district attorney is unable to present restitution evidence at sentencing, within 90 days after sentencing the district attorney may file a motion requesting that either the judgment be amended to require restitution or that a supplemental judgment be entered requiring restitution. The court may extend the time by which the district attorney must file the motion for good cause. The motion must contain a statement that documentation supporting the requested amount of restitution has been provided to the defendant as described in subsection (7) of this section. (B) Upon receipt of a motion described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the court shall set a hearing. If the defendant objects to the motion, the objection must be filed at least 15 days prior to the hearing and must contain a description of the nature of the objection. (C) If the parties stipulate to the order and amount of restitution, the court may cancel the hearing and amend the judgment or enter a supplemental judgment requiring the defendant to pay the stipulated amount of restitution. (c) At a restitution proceeding, economic damages will be presumed reasonable if the damages are documented in the form of a record, bill, estimate or invoice from a business, health care entity or provider or public body as defined in ORS 174.109. (2)(a) If the court finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages, in addition to any other sanction it may impose, the court shall enter a judgment or supplemental judgment requiring that the defendant pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that equals the full amount of the victims economic damages as determined by the court. The lien, priority of the lien and ability to enforce the specific amount of restitution established under this paragraph by a supplemental judgment relates back to the date of the original judgment that is supplemented. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, a court may order that the defendant pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that is less than the full amount of the victims economic damages only if: (A) The victim or, if the victim is an estate, successor in interest, trust or other entity, an authorized representative of the victim consents to the lesser amount, if the conviction is not for a person felony; or (B) The victim or, if the victim is an estate, successor in interest, trust or other entity, an authorized representative of the victim consents in writing to the lesser amount, if the conviction is for a person felony. (c) As used in this subsection, person felony has the meaning given that term in the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission. (3) After the district attorney makes a presentation described in subsection (1) of this section, if the court is unable to find from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages, the court shall make a finding on the record to that effect. (4) No finding made by the court or failure of the court to make a finding under this section limits or impairs the rights of a person injured to sue and recover damages in a civil action as provided in ORS 137.109. (5)(a) If a judgment or supplemental judgment described in subsection (1) of this section includes restitution, a court may delay the enforcement of the monetary sanctions, including restitution, only if the defendant alleges and establishes to the satisfaction of the court the defendants inability to pay the judgment in full at the time the judgment is entered. If the court finds that the defendant is unable to pay, the court may establish or allow an appropriate supervising authority to establish a payment schedule, taking into consideration the financial resources of the defendant and the burden that payment of restitution will impose, with due regard to the other obligations of the defendant. The supervising authority shall be authorized to modify any payment schedule established under this section. (b) As used in this subsection, supervising authority means any state or local agency that is authorized to supervise the defendant. (6) If the defendant objects to the imposition, amount or distribution of the restitution, the court shall allow the defendant to be heard on such issue at the time of sentencing or at the time the court determines the amount of restitution. (7)(a) At least 10 days prior to the presentation described in subsection (1) of this section, the district attorney shall: (A) Disclose to the defendant the names of any witnesses that may be called during the presentation; and (B) Provide the defendant with copies of, or allow the defendant to inspect, any exhibits that will be used or introduced during the presentation. (b) If the court finds that the district attorney has violated the requirements of this subsection, the court shall grant a continuance to allow additional time for preparation upon request of the defendant.

(1) If the court imposes a sentence upon conviction of a felony that includes a term of incarceration that exceeds 12 months: (a) The court shall not designate the correctional facility in which the defendant is to be confined but shall commit the defendant to the legal and physical custody of the Department of Corrections; and (b) If the judgment provides that the term of incarceration be served consecutively to a term of incarceration of 12 months or less that was imposed in a previous proceeding by a court of this state upon conviction of a felony, the defendant shall serve any remaining part of the previously imposed term of incarceration in the legal and physical custody of the Department of Corrections. (2)(a) If the court imposes a sentence upon conviction of a felony that includes a term of incarceration that is 12 months or less, the court shall commit the defendant to the legal and physical custody of the supervisory authority of the county in which the crime of conviction occurred. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, when the court imposes a sentence upon conviction of a felony that includes a term of incarceration that is 12 months or less, the court shall commit the defendant to the legal and physical custody of the Department of Corrections if the court orders that the term of incarceration be served consecutively to a term of incarceration that exceeds 12 months that was imposed in a previous proceeding or in the same proceeding by a court of this state upon conviction of a felony. (3) After assuming custody of the convicted person the Department of Corrections may transfer adults in custody from one correctional facility to another such facility for the purposes of diagnosis and study, rehabilitation and treatment, as best seems to fit the needs of the adult in custody and for the protection and welfare of the community and the adult in custody. (4) If the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment upon conviction of a misdemeanor, it shall commit the defendant to the custody of the supervisory authority of the county in which the crime of conviction occurred. (5)(a) When a person under 18 years of age at the time of committing the offense and under 20 years of age at the time of sentencing is committed to the Department of Corrections under ORS 137.707 or due to the fact that criminal proceedings were initiated after the person attained 18 years of age, the Department of Corrections shall transfer the physical custody of the person to the Oregon Youth Authority as provided in ORS 420.011 if: (A) The person will complete the sentence imposed before the person attains 25 years of age; (B) The Department of Corrections and the Oregon Youth Authority determine that, because of the persons age, immaturity, mental or emotional condition or risk of physical harm to the person, the person should not be incarcerated initially in a Department of Corrections institution; or (C) The person is under 18 years of age at the time of sentencing and commitment. (b) A person placed in the custody of the Oregon Youth Authority under this subsection who is at least 18 years of age shall be returned to the physical custody of the Department of Corrections whenever the Director of the Oregon Youth Authority, after consultation with the Department of Corrections, determines that the conditions or circumstances that warranted the transfer of custody under this subsection are no longer present. (c) Notwithstanding ORS 137.320, the sheriff may by agreement with the Department of Corrections transfer the person described in this subsection directly to a youth correction facility for physical custody without first delivering the person to the Department of Corrections. As part of the agreement with the Department of Corrections, the sheriff may designate the county juvenile department or the Oregon Youth Authority to conduct the direct transfer described in this paragraph if the sheriff has entered into a written agreement with the county juvenile department, the Oregon Youth Authority, or both, to provide the direct transfer. (6)(a) When a person under 18 years of age at the time of committing the offense and under 20 years of age at the time of sentencing is committed to the legal and physical custody of the Department of Corrections or the supervisory authority of a county following waiver under ORS 419C.349 (1)(b), 419C.352, 419C.364 or 419C.370 or sentencing under ORS 137.707 (5)(b)(A) or (7)(b) or 137.712, the Department of Corrections or the supervisory authority of a county shall transfer the person to the physical custody of the Oregon Youth Authority for placement as provided in ORS 420.011 (3). The terms and conditions of the persons incarceration and custody are governed by ORS 420A.200 to 420A.206. Notwithstanding ORS 137.320, the sheriff may by agreement with the Department of Corrections or the supervisory authority of a county transfer the person described in this subsection directly to a youth correction facility for physical custody without first delivering the person to the Department of Corrections or supervisory authority of the county. As part of the agreement with the Department of Corrections or supervisory authority of the county, the sheriff may designate the county juvenile department or the Oregon Youth Authority to conduct the direct transfer described in this paragraph if the sheriff has entered into a written agreement with the county juvenile department, the Oregon Youth Authority, or both, to provide the direct transfer. (b) Notwithstanding ORS 137.320, when a person under 16 years of age is waived under ORS 419C.349 (1)(b), 419C.352, 419C.364 or 419C.370 and subsequently is sentenced to a term of imprisonment in the county jail, the sheriff shall transfer the person to a youth correction facility for physical custody as provided in ORS 420.011 (3). (7) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (5)(a)(A) of this section, the department or the supervisory authority of a county may not transfer the physical custody of the person under subsection (5)(a)(A) of this section if the Director of the Oregon Youth Authority, after consultation with the Department of Corrections or the supervisory authority of a county, determines that, because of the persons age, mental or emotional condition or risk of physical harm to other persons, the person should not be incarcerated in a youth correction facility. (8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no circumstances may a person under 18 years of age be incarcerated in a Department of Corrections institution. (9) If a defendant is transferred under subsection (5) or (6) of this section, the defendant shall also be transferred after a resentencing on the same charges resulting from an appellate decision or a post-conviction relief proceeding or for any other reason, even if the defendant is 20 years of age or older at the time of the resentencing. (10) For the purposes of determining the persons age at the time of committing an offense under this section: (a) If the person is convicted of two or more offenses occurring on different days, the persons age shall be calculated using the earliest date. (b) If the person is convicted of an offense occurring within a range of dates, the persons age shall be calculated using the date at the beginning of the range.

(b) Type 2 obligations include awards of restitution as defined in ORS 137.103, awards of restitution under ORS 419C.450 and money awards made under ORS 811.706. (2) If a judgment contains both types of Level I obligations, the local court shall apply amounts creditable to Type 1 obligations until paid in full. All subsequent amounts creditable to Level I obligations shall be applied against Type 2 obligations until paid in full. (3) If there is more than one person for whose benefit a Type 2 money award has been made, a local court shall pay the moneys credited to Type 2 obligations in the following order of priority: (a) If the judgment contains a money award payable to the person or persons against whom the defendant committed the offense, the court shall first pay all moneys credited to Type 2 obligations to those persons, and shall continue to do so until all those obligations are paid in full. If there is more than one person to whom an obligation is payable under this paragraph, the court shall divide each payment under this paragraph based on each persons proportionate share of the total amount of obligations subject to payment under this paragraph. (b) If the judgment contains a money award payable to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Account, the court shall thereafter transfer moneys credited to Type 2 obligations to the account until the award is paid in full. (c) If the judgment contains a money award payable to any other victims, as defined in ORS 137.103, the court shall thereafter pay the moneys credited to Type 2 obligations to those victims until those victims are paid in full.",

      "text": "Interest on judgments; waiver; payments. (1)(a) Criminal judgments bear interest at the rate provided by ORS 82.010. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, criminal judgments bear interest for a period of 20 years after the judgment is entered. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, criminal judgments begin to accrue interest on the date the judgment is entered and do not bear interest after the expiration of the 20-year period. (b) When a person is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, interest on a judgment in a criminal action does not begin to accrue until the first day of the second full calendar month after the persons initial release from custody following the sentencing in which the monetary obligation was imposed. If the judgment includes a money award for restitution, the judgment accrues interest for a period of 20 years after the first day of the second full calendar month after the persons initial release from custody following the sentencing in which the monetary obligation was imposed. (2) The State Court Administrator may waive interest, or cause waiver of interest, on any criminal judgment or category of criminal judgments for the purpose of administering the collection of judgments of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, the Oregon Tax Court and circuit courts. A judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, the Oregon Tax Court or a circuit court may waive interest in any criminal action or proceeding for good cause shown. (3) A municipal judge may waive interest on any criminal judgment, or category of criminal judgments, entered in the municipal court in which the judge presides. A justice of the peace may waive interest on any criminal judgment, or category of criminal judgments, entered in the justice court in which the justice of the peace presides. (4) A waiver under subsection (2) or (3) of this section may be for all or part of the interest payable on a criminal judgment and may be for a specified period of time. (5) All payments collected under a criminal judgment must first be applied against the principal amount of a money award. Payments may be applied against interest on the money award only after the principal amount of the money award is paid. This subsection applies only to judgments of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, the Oregon Tax Court and circuit courts. (6) Moneys collected as interest under a criminal judgment may be applied against costs of collection. Except as provided in subsection (7) of this section: (a) Any amounts of moneys collected as interest on judgments of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Oregon Tax Court or circuit courts that remain after payment of collection costs shall be deposited in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Account to be used for the purposes specified in ORS 147.225. (b) Any amounts of moneys collected as interest on judgments of the municipal or justice courts that remain after payment of collection costs shall be deposited in the general fund of the city or county in which the court operates and be available for general governmental purposes. (7) After any payment of costs of collection, any interest collected on an award for restitution on and after January 1, 2012, must be paid to the person in whose favor the award of restitution was made. (8) As used in this section, criminal judgment means a judgment entered in a criminal action as defined in ORS 131.005. [1999 c.1064 2; 2005 c.618 7; 2007 c.626 1] Note:",

(4) If the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the person was the victim of sex trafficking at or around the time of the conduct giving rise to the prostitution conviction, the court shall grant the motion. (5) If the court grants a motion under this section, the court shall vacate the judgment of conviction for prostitution and may make other orders as the court considers appropriate. (6) If the court grants a motion under this section while an appeal of the judgment of conviction is pending, the court shall immediately forward a copy of the vacation order to the appellate court. (7) As used in this section: (a) Municipal prostitution ordinance means a municipal ordinance prohibiting a person from engaging in, or offering or agreeing to engage in, sexual conduct or sexual contact in return for a fee.

      "text": "Order setting aside judgment of guilty except for insanity; fees; procedure; effect of order. (1) A person who has been found guilty except for insanity of an offense for which, if convicted, the person could apply for entry of an order setting aside the conviction pursuant to ORS 137.225, may by motion apply to the court for entry of an order setting aside the judgment finding the person guilty except for insanity of the offense. (2)(a) A person described in subsection (1) of this section may file the motion to set aside a judgment of guilty except for insanity any time after the following time periods: (A) For a judgment of guilty except for insanity on a Class B felony, seven years from the date of entry of the judgment or the date the person is no longer under the jurisdiction of the Psychiatric Security Review Board, whichever is later. (B) For a judgment of guilty except for insanity on a Class C felony, five years from the date of entry of the judgment or the date the person is no longer under the jurisdiction of the board, whichever is later. (C) For a judgment of guilty except for insanity on a Class A misdemeanor, three years from the date of entry of the judgment or the date the person is no longer under the jurisdiction of the board, whichever is later. (D) For a judgment of guilty except for insanity on a Class B or Class C misdemeanor, one year from the date of entry of the judgment or the date the person is no longer under the jurisdiction of the board, whichever is later. (b) A person is eligible to have a judgment of guilty except for insanity set aside under this section if the person has no other findings of guilty except for insanity and no convictions for offenses other than motor vehicle violations within the following time periods prior to filing the motion: (A) For a motion concerning a judgment of guilty except for insanity on a Class B felony, seven years. (B) For a motion concerning a judgment of guilty except for insanity on a Class C felony, five years. (C) For a motion concerning a judgment of guilty except for insanity on a Class A misdemeanor, three years. (D) For a motion concerning a judgment of guilty except for insanity on a Class B or Class C misdemeanor, one year. (3)(a) A copy of the motion shall be served upon the office of the prosecuting attorney who prosecuted the offense. The prosecuting attorney may object to the motion filed and shall notify the court and the person of the objection within 120 days of receiving the motion. (b) When a prosecuting attorney is served with a copy of a motion to set aside a judgment of guilty except for insanity under this section, the prosecuting attorney shall provide a copy of the motion and notice of the hearing date to the victim, if any, of the offense by mailing a copy of the motion and notice to the victims last-known address. (c) When a person files a motion under this section, the person must pay a fee to the Department of State Police for the purpose of the department performing a criminal record check, and shall forward to the department a full set of the persons fingerprints on a fingerprint card or in any other manner specified by the department. The department shall establish a fee in an amount not to exceed the actual cost of performing the criminal record check. If the department is required to perform only one criminal record check for the person, the department may only charge one fee, regardless of the number of counties in which the person is filing a motion to set aside a conviction, arrest, charge or citation under this section. The department shall provide a copy of the results of the criminal record check to the prosecuting attorney. (d) A person filing a motion under this section is not required to pay the filing fee established under ORS 21.135. (4)(a) If an objection is received to a motion filed under this section, the court shall hold a hearing, and may require the filing of such affidavits and may require the taking of such proofs as the court deems proper. The court shall allow the victim to make a statement at the hearing. If the person is otherwise eligible for relief under this section, the court shall grant the motion and enter an order as described in paragraph (b) of this subsection unless the court makes written findings, by clear and convincing evidence, that the circumstances and behavior of the person, from the date of the judgment the person is seeking to set aside to the date of the hearing on the motion, do not warrant granting the motion due to the circumstances and behavior creating a risk to public safety. When determining whether the persons circumstances and behavior create a risk to public safety, the court may only consider criminal behavior, or violations of regulatory law or administrative rule enforced by civil penalty or other administrative sanction that relate to the character of the conviction sought to be set aside. The court may not consider nonpunitive civil liability, monetary obligations and motor vehicle violations. (b) An order entered under this subsection shall state the original arrest charge and the charge for which the person was found guilty except for insanity. The order shall further state that positive identification has been established by the Department of State Police and further identified as to Department of State Police number or submitting agency number. (5)(a) Upon the entry of an order under subsection (4) of this section: (A) The person, for purposes of the law, shall be deemed not to have been previously found guilty except for insanity, and the court shall issue an order sealing the records of the case, including the records of arrest, whether or not the arrest resulted in a further criminal proceeding. (B) The court shall inform the person that the persons right to possess, purchase or otherwise acquire a firearm remains prohibited under federal law. (b) For purposes of this subsection, records of the case do not include medical records that are in the possession of the Psychiatric Security Review Board, including medical evaluations and reports submitted from other agencies concerning the status or compliance of the person. (6) The clerk of the court shall forward a certified copy of the order entered under subsection (5) of this section to such agencies as directed by the court. A certified copy shall be sent to the Psychiatric Security Review Board. Upon entry of the order, the judgment of guilty except for insanity shall be deemed not to have been entered, and the person may answer accordingly any questions relating to its occurrence. (7) For purposes of any civil action in which truth is an element of a claim for relief or affirmative defense, the provisions of subsection (6) of this section providing that the judgment of guilty except for insanity be deemed not to have been entered do not apply and a party may apply to the court for an order requiring disclosure of the official records in the case as may be necessary in the interests of justice. (8) Upon motion of any prosecutor or defendant in a case involving records sealed under this section, supported by affidavit showing good cause, the court with jurisdiction may order the reopening and disclosure of any records sealed under this section for the limited purpose of assisting the investigation of the movant. However, such an order has no other effect on the orders setting aside the judgment of guilty except for insanity. (9) A prosecuting attorney may not condition an agreement not to object to the entry of a judgment of guilty except for insanity on an agreement by a person to waive the ability to set aside the judgment under this section. (10) As used in this section, affidavit includes a declaration under penalty of perjury. [2015 c.320 1; 2017 c.442 16; 2021 c.486 2] Note:",

Upon granting the motion, the court shall enter an appropriate order containing the original arrest or citation charge, the conviction charge, if different from the original, the date of charge, the submitting agency and the disposition of the charge. Upon the entry of the order, the person for purposes of the law shall be deemed not to have been previously convicted, and the court shall issue an order sealing the record of conviction and other official records in the case, including the records of arrest, citation or charge.

When a person is convicted of an offense and sentenced to pay any monetary obligation, the following provisions apply to obtaining a satisfaction of the money award portion of the judgment or a release of a judgment lien from a specific parcel of real property when the money award portion of the judgment is not satisfied: (1) The Attorney General, by rule, may do any of the following: (a) Authorize the Attorney Generals office, a district attorneys office, any state agency within the executive branch of government or any specific individual or group within any of these to: (A) Issue satisfactions of the money award portions of judgments; or (B) Release a judgment lien from a specific parcel of real property when either the judgment lien does not attach to any equity in the real property or the amount of equity in the real property to which the judgment lien attaches, less costs of sale or other reasonable expenses, is paid upon the judgment. (b) Establish procedures and requirements that any person described under paragraph (a) of this subsection must follow to issue satisfactions or releases. (2) Authorization of a person under subsection (1) of this section is permissive and such person is not required to issue satisfactions or releases if authorized. However, if a person is authorized under subsection (1) of this section and does issue satisfactions or releases, the person must comply with the procedures and requirements established by the Attorney General by rule. (3) If the Attorney General establishes a program under subsection (1) of this section, the Attorney Generals office shall issue satisfactions and releases under the program unless the Attorney General determines that there are sufficient other agencies authorized under subsection (1) of this section who are actually participating in the program to provide reasonable access to satisfactions and releases on a statewide basis. (4)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, when the entries in the register and the financial accounting records for the court show conclusively that a monetary obligation imposed in a criminal action has been paid in full, the clerk of the court may note in the register that the money award portion of the judgment has been paid in full. Notation in the register under this paragraph constitutes a satisfaction of the money award portion of the judgment. The clerk of the court is not civilly liable for any act or omission in making the notation in the register in the manner authorized by this paragraph. (b) When a monetary obligation imposed in a criminal action is paid by a negotiable instrument, the clerk of the court shall proceed as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection only after the expiration of 21 days from the date the negotiable instrument is received by the court. The clerk may proceed as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection before the expiration of the 21-day period if the judgment debtor or any other interested person makes a request that the clerk proceed and provides information that establishes to the satisfaction of the clerk that the instrument has been honored. (c) This subsection does not authorize the clerk of a court to compromise, settle or partially satisfy a monetary obligation imposed in a criminal action, or to release part of any property subject to a judgment lien. (5) Any satisfaction issued by a person authorized under this section may be entered in the same manner and has the same effect on the money award portion of a judgment as a satisfaction issued for the money award portions of a judgment from a civil action or proceeding. (6) The release of judgment liens on specific parcels of real property by the Attorney General or by a person authorized by the Attorney General under subsection (1) of this section is discretionary. The money award portion of the judgment shall remain a lien against all real property not specifically released. [1989 c.472 4; 1993 c.145 1; 1997 c.801 68; 2003 c.576 164] Note:",

(1) When a sentence of death is pronounced, the clerk of the court shall deliver a copy of the judgment of conviction and sentence of death to the sheriff of the county. The sheriff shall deliver the defendant within 20 days from the date the judgment is entered to the correctional institution designated by the Director of the Department of Corrections pending the determination of the automatic and direct review by the Supreme Court under ORS 138.052. (2) If the Supreme Court affirms the sentence of death, a death warrant hearing shall take place in the court in which the judgment was rendered within 30 days after the effective date of the appellate judgment or, upon motion of the state, on a later date. The following apply to a death warrant hearing under this subsection: (a) The defendant must be present; and (b) The defendant may be represented by counsel. If the defendant was represented by appointed counsel on automatic and direct review, that counsels appointment continues for purposes of the death warrant hearing and any related matters. If that counsel is unavailable, the court shall appoint counsel pursuant to the procedure in ORS 135.050 and 135.055. (3)(a) If the defendant indicates the wish to waive the right to counsel for the purpose of the death warrant hearing, the court shall inquire of the defendant on the record to ensure that the waiver is competent, knowing and voluntary. (b) If the court finds that the waiver is competent, knowing and voluntary, the court shall discharge counsel. (c) If the court finds on the record that the waiver of the right to counsel granted by this section is not competent, knowing or voluntary, the court shall continue the appointment of counsel. (d) Notwithstanding the fact that the court finds on the record that the defendant competently, knowingly and voluntarily waives the right to counsel, the court may continue the appointment of counsel as advisor only for the purposes of the death warrant hearing. (4) At the death warrant hearing, the court: (a) After appropriate inquiry, shall make findings on the record whether the defendant suffers from a mental condition that prevents the defendant from comprehending the reasons for the death sentence or its implication. The defendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant suffers from a mental condition that prevents the defendant from comprehending the reasons for the death sentence or its implication. (b) Shall advise the defendant that the defendant is entitled to counsel in any post-conviction proceeding and that counsel will be appointed if the defendant is financially eligible for appointed counsel at state expense. (c) Shall determine whether the defendant intends to pursue any challenges to the sentence or conviction. If the defendant states on the record that the defendant does not intend to challenge the sentence or conviction, the court after advising the defendant of the consequences shall make a finding on the record whether the defendant competently, knowingly and voluntarily waives the right to pursue: (A) A petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court; (B) Post-conviction relief under ORS 138.510 to 138.680; and (C) Federal habeas corpus review under 28 U.S.C. 2254. (5) Following the death warrant hearing, a death warrant, signed by the trial judge of the court in which the judgment was rendered and attested by the clerk of that court, shall be drawn and delivered to the superintendent of the correctional institution designated by the Director of the Department of Corrections. The death warrant shall specify a day on which the sentence of death is to be executed and shall authorize and command the superintendent to execute the judgment of the court. The trial court shall specify the date of execution of the sentence, taking into consideration the needs of the Department of Corrections. The trial court shall specify a date not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days following the effective date of the appellate judgment. (6)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, if the court finds that the defendant suffers from a mental condition that prevents the defendant from comprehending the reasons for the sentence of death or its implications, the court may not issue a death warrant until such time as the court, after appropriate inquiries, finds that the defendant is able to comprehend the reasons for the sentence of death and its implications. (b)(A) If the court does not issue a death warrant because it finds that the defendant suffers from a mental condition that prevents the defendant from comprehending the reasons for the sentence of death or its implications, the court shall conduct subsequent hearings on the issue on motion of the district attorney or the defendants counsel or on the courts own motion, upon a showing that there is substantial reason to believe that the defendants condition has changed. (B) The court may hold a hearing under this paragraph no more frequently than once every six months. (C) The state and the defendant may obtain an independent medical, psychiatric or psychological examination of the defendant in connection with a hearing under this paragraph. (D) In a hearing under this paragraph, the defendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant continues to suffer from a mental condition that prevents the defendant from comprehending the reasons for the sentence of death or its implications. (7) If for any reason a sentence of death is not executed on the date appointed in the death warrant, and the sentence of death remains in force and is not stayed under ORS 138.686 or otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction, the court that issued the initial death warrant, on motion of the state and without further hearing, shall issue a new death warrant specifying a new date on which the sentence is to be executed. The court shall specify a date for execution of the sentence, taking into consideration the needs of the Department of Corrections. The court shall specify a date not more than 20 days after the date on which the states motion was filed. (8) No appeal may be taken from an order issued pursuant to this section.",

The terms of the probation shall be defined by a probation agreement. (b) A probation agreement carries the understanding that if the defendant fulfills the terms of the agreement, the criminal charges filed against the defendant will be dismissed with prejudice. (c) The agreement must contain a waiver of the following rights of the defendant with respect to each criminal charge: (A) The right to a speedy trial and trial by jury; (B) The right to present evidence on the defendants behalf; (C) The right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against the defendant; (D) The right to contest evidence presented against the defendant, including the right to object to hearsay evidence; and (E) The right to appeal from a judgment of conviction resulting from an adjudication of guilt entered under subsection (2) of this section, unless the appeal is based on an allegation that the sentence exceeds the maximum allowed by law or constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. (d) The agreement must include a requirement that the defendant pay any restitution owed to the victim as determined by the court, and any fees for court-appointed counsel ordered by the court under ORS 135.050. (e) The agreement may not contain a requirement that the defendant enter a plea of guilty or no contest on any charge in the accusatory instrument. (f) Entering into a probation agreement does not constitute an admission of guilt and is not sufficient to warrant a finding or adjudication of guilt by a court. (g) Police reports or other documents associated with the criminal charges in a court file other than the probation agreement may not be admitted into evidence, and do not establish a factual basis for finding the defendant guilty, unless the court resumes criminal proceedings and enters an adjudication of guilt under subsection (2) of this section. (2) Upon violation of a term or condition of the probation agreement, the court may resume the criminal proceedings and may find the defendant guilty of the offenses in the accusatory instrument in accordance with the waiver of rights in the probation agreement. The defendant may not contest the sufficiency of the evidence establishing the defendants guilt of the offenses in the accusatory instrument. (3) Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions of the probation agreement, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against the person. Discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of this section or for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime. There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with respect to any person. (4) In the event that the period of probation under this section expires, but the terms and conditions of the probation agreement have not been fulfilled and no probation violation proceeding was initiated prior to the expiration of the period of probation, the court may not discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against the person. The court shall instead issue an order requiring the person to appear and to show cause why the court should not enter an adjudication of guilt as described in subsection (2) of this section due to the failure of the person to fulfill the terms and conditions of the probation agreement prior to expiration of the period of probation. At the hearing on the order to show cause, after considering any evidence or argument from the district attorney and the person, the court may: (a) Order a new period of probation to allow the person to fulfill the terms and conditions of the probation agreement; or (b) Enter an adjudication of guilt as described in subsection (2) of this section. (5) Nothing in this section is intended to restrict a persons participation in a specialty court or conditional discharge under ORS 475.245.

      "text": "Period of probation; discharge from probation; proceedings in case of violation of conditions. (1) Subject to the limitations in ORS 137.010 and to rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission for felonies committed on or after November 1, 1989: (a) The period of probation shall be as the court determines and may, in the discretion of the court, be continued or extended. (b) The court may at any time discharge a person from probation. (2) At any time during the probation period, the court may issue a warrant and cause a defendant to be arrested for violating any of the conditions of probation. Any parole and probation officer, police officer or other officer with power of arrest may arrest a probationer without a warrant for violating any condition of probation, and a statement by the parole and probation officer or arresting officer setting forth that the probationer has, in the judgment of the parole and probation officer or arresting officer, violated the conditions of probation is sufficient warrant for the detention of the probationer in the county jail until the probationer can be brought before the court or until the parole and probation officer or supervisory personnel impose and the offender agrees to structured, intermediate sanctions in accordance with the rules adopted under ORS 137.595. Disposition shall be made during the first 36 hours in custody, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, unless later disposition is authorized by supervisory personnel. If authorized by supervisory personnel, the disposition shall take place in no more than five judicial days. If the offender does not consent to structured, intermediate sanctions imposed by the parole and probation officer or supervisory personnel in accordance with the rules adopted under ORS 137.595, the parole and probation officer, as soon as practicable, but within one judicial day, shall report the arrest or detention to the court that imposed the probation. The parole and probation officer shall promptly submit to the court a report showing in what manner the probationer has violated the conditions of probation. (3) Except for good cause shown or at the request of the probationer, the probationer shall be brought before a magistrate during the first 36 hours of custody, excluding holidays, Saturdays and Sundays. That magistrate, in the exercise of discretion, may order the probationer held pending a violation or revocation hearing or pending transfer to the jurisdiction of another court where the probation was imposed. In lieu of an order that the probationer be held, the magistrate may release the probationer upon the condition that the probationer appear in court at a later date for a probation violation or revocation hearing. If the probationer is being held on an out-of-county warrant, the magistrate may order the probationer released subject to an additional order to the probationer that the probationer report within seven calendar days to the court that imposed the probation. (4) When a probationer has been sentenced to probation in more than one county and the probationer is being held on an out-of-county warrant for a probation violation, the court may consider consolidation of some or all pending probation violation proceedings pursuant to rules made and orders issued by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court under ORS 137.547: (a) Upon the motion of the district attorney or defense counsel in the county in which the probationer is held; or (b) Upon the courts own motion. (5)(a) For defendants sentenced for felonies committed prior to November 1, 1989, and for any misdemeanor, the court that imposed the probation, after summary hearing, may revoke the probation and: (A) If the execution of some other part of the sentence has been suspended, the court shall cause the rest of the sentence imposed to be executed. (B) If no other sentence has been imposed, the court may impose any other sentence which originally could have been imposed. (b) For defendants sentenced for felonies committed on or after November 1, 1989, the court that imposed the probationary sentence may revoke probation supervision and impose a sanction as provided by rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission. (6) Except for good cause shown, if the revocation hearing is not conducted within 14 calendar days following the arrest or detention of the probationer, the probationer shall be released from custody. (7) A defendant who has been previously confined in the county jail as a condition of probation pursuant to ORS 137.540 or as part of a probationary sentence pursuant to the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission may be given credit for all time thus served in any order or judgment of confinement resulting from revocation of probation. (8) In the case of any defendant whose sentence has been suspended but who has not been sentenced to probation, the court may issue a warrant and cause the defendant to be arrested and brought before the court at any time within the maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced. Thereupon the court, after summary hearing, may revoke the suspension of sentence and cause the sentence imposed to be executed. (9) If a probationer fails to appear or report to a court for further proceedings as required by an order under subsection (3) of this section, the failure to appear may be prosecuted in the county to which the probationer was ordered to appear or report. (10) The probationer may admit or deny the violation by being physically present at the hearing or by means of simultaneous electronic transmission as described in ORS 131.045. (11) The victim has the right: (a) Upon request made within the time period prescribed in the notice required by ORS 147.417, to be notified of any hearing before the court that may result in the revocation of the defendants probation for a felony or person Class A misdemeanor. The notification shall be provided by: (A) The district attorney if the defendant is not supervised by the supervisory authority or if the defendant is supervised by the supervisory authority and the district attorney initiates a request with the court for a probation violation or revocation hearing. (B) The supervisory authority if the defendant is supervised by the supervisory authority and the supervisory authority initiates a request with the court for a probation violation or revocation hearing. (b) To appear personally at the hearing. (c) If present, to reasonably express any views relevant to the issues before the court. (12) As used in this section: (a) Person Class A misdemeanor has the meaning given that term in the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission. (b) Supervisory authority has the meaning given that term in ORS 144.087. [Formerly",

When the court imposes a sentence under this subsection, the person is eligible for a reduction in the sentence as provided in ORS 421.121 and any other statute and is eligible for a hearing and conditional release under ORS 420A.203 and 420A.206.

(2) A conviction is subject to subsection (1) of this section only if the sentencing court finds on the record by a preponderance of the evidence: (a) If the conviction is for manslaughter in the second degree: (A) That the victim was a dependent person as defined in ORS 163.205 who was at least 18 years of age; (B) That the defendant is the mother or father of the victim; (C) That the death of the victim was the result of an injury or illness that was not caused by the defendant; (D) That the defendant treated the injury or illness solely by spiritual treatment in accordance with the religious beliefs or practices of the defendant and based on a good faith belief that spiritual treatment would bring about the victims recovery from the injury or illness; (E) That no other person previously under the defendants care has died or sustained significant physical injury as a result of or despite the use of spiritual treatment, regardless of whether the spiritual treatment was used alone or in conjunction with medical care; and (F) That the defendant does not have a previous conviction for a crime listed in subsection (4) of this section or for criminal mistreatment in the second degree.

(3)(a) A presumptive sentence described in subsection (1)(a) or (b) of this section shall be increased by two months for each previous conviction the person has that: (A) Was for any of the crimes listed in subsection (1) or (2) of this section; and (B) Was not used as a predicate for the presumptive sentence described in subsection (1)(a) or (b) of this section. (b) Previous convictions may not increase a presumptive sentence described in subsection (1)(a) or (b) of this section by more than 12 months under this subsection. (4) The court may impose a sentence other than the sentence provided by subsection (1) or (3) of this section if the court imposes: (a) A longer term of incarceration that is otherwise required or authorized by law; or (b) A departure sentence authorized by the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission based upon findings of substantial and compelling reasons. Unless the law or the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission allow for imposition of a longer sentence, the maximum departure allowed for a person sentenced under this subsection is double the presumptive sentence provided in subsection (1) or (3) of this section. (5) Notwithstanding subsection (4)(b) of this section, the court may not sentence a person under subsection (4) of this section to a term of incarceration that exceeds the period of time described in ORS 161.605.

(7) When the court imposes a sentence of probation for a conviction for theft in the first degree or identity theft or under subsection (6) of this section, the supervisory authority as defined in ORS 144.087 may require the person to receive a high level of supervision for at least 12 months, and may extend the period of high-level supervision for all or part of the remaining probationary term. (8)(a) For a crime committed on or after November 1, 1989, a conviction is considered to have occurred upon the pronouncement of sentence in open court. However, when sentences are imposed for two or more convictions arising out of the same conduct or criminal episode, none of the convictions is considered to have occurred prior to any of the other convictions arising out of the same conduct or criminal episode. (b) For a crime committed prior to November 1, 1989, a conviction is considered to have occurred upon the pronouncement in open court of a sentence or upon the pronouncement in open court of the suspended imposition of a sentence. (9) For purposes of this section, previous convictions must be proven pursuant to ORS 137.079. (10) As used in this section: (a) Downward departure means a downward dispositional departure or a downward durational departure under the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission. (b) Previous conviction includes: (A) Convictions occurring before, on or after July 1, 2003; and (B) Convictions entered in any other state or federal court for comparable offenses.
