(1) As used in this section: (a) Airbag means an inflatable restraint device for occupants of motor vehicles that is part of an automobile supplemental restraint system. (b) Automobile supplemental restraint system means a passive inflatable crash protection system that a vehicle manufacturer designs to protect automobile occupants in conjunction with a seat belt assembly, as defined in 49 C.F.R. 571.209, and that has one or more airbags and all components required to ensure that each airbag: (A) Operates as designed in a crash; and (B) Meets federal motor vehicle safety standards for the specific make, model and year of manufacture of the vehicle in which the airbag is installed. (c) Counterfeit automobile supplemental restraint system component means a replacement component, including an airbag, that without the authorization of a manufacturer, or a person that supplies parts to the manufacturer, displays a trademark that is identical or substantially similar to the manufacturers or suppliers genuine trademark. (d)(A) Nonfunctional airbag means a replacement airbag that: (i) Was previously deployed or damaged; (ii) Has a fault that a motor vehicles diagnostic systems detect once the airbag is installed; (iii) May not be sold or leased under 49 U.S.C. 30120(j); or (iv) Includes a counterfeit automobile supplemental restraint system component or other part or object that is installed for the purpose of misleading a motor vehicle owner or operator into believing that a functional airbag is installed. (B) Nonfunctional airbag does not include an unrepaired deployed airbag or an airbag that is installed in a motor vehicle: (i) That has been declared a total loss or is otherwise a totaled vehicle, as defined in ORS 801.527; or (ii) For which the owner was issued a salvage title certificate or a similar title from another state. (2)(a) A person may not knowingly or intentionally: (A) Manufacture, import, distribute, offer for sale, sell or lease or otherwise transfer, or install or reinstall into a motor vehicle, a counterfeit automobile supplemental restraint system component, a nonfunctional airbag or an object that replaces an automobile supplemental restraint system component and does not comply with Standard No. 208, 49 C.F.R 571.208, for the make, model and year of the motor vehicle; or (B) Install or reinstall as part of an automobile supplemental restraint system any object, component, part or device that causes a motor vehicles diagnostic system to fail to warn the motor vehicle operator that an airbag is not installed, or that a counterfeit automobile supplemental restraint system component or nonfunctional airbag is installed in the motor vehicle. (b) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection, an installation of a counterfeit automobile supplemental restraint system component, a nonfunctional airbag or an object that replaces an automobile supplemental restraint system component and does not comply with Standard No. 208, 49 C.F.R 571.208, for the make, model and year of the motor vehicle does not occur until the installation work is complete and the earlier of these two conditions occurs: (A) The motor vehicle is returned to the operator; or (B) Title to the motor vehicle is transferred.

(b) Any fender or mudguard required under this section must be of sufficient size and must be so constructed as to be capable at all times of arresting and deflecting any dirt, mud, water or other substance that may be picked up and carried by the wheels. (2) The following types of fenders or mudguards must cover the wheels of the vehicle in the manner described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this subsection: (a) Type I fenders or mudguards must extend in full width from a point on the wheels that is above and forward of the center of the tires over to a point at the rear of the wheels that is not more than 10 inches, or, if attached to the rear of a dump box that elevates for unloading, not more than 13 inches, above the surface of the highway when the vehicle is empty. (b) Type II fenders or mudguards must extend downward in full width from a point behind the wheels that is not lower than halfway between the center of the wheels and the top of the tires to a point at the rear of the wheels that is not more than 10 inches above the surface of the highway when the vehicle is empty.

(3) Tinting material that has a lower light transmittance or produces a lower total light transmittance than permitted in subsection (2)(a) and (c) of this section may be applied to the top six inches of a windshield. Tinting material may not be applied to any other portion of the windshield. (4) Tinting material that has a lower light transmittance or produces a lower total light transmittance than permitted in subsection (2)(a) and (c) of this section may be applied to all windows of a multipurpose passenger vehicle that are behind the driver. This subsection applies only to vehicles that are equipped with rearview mirrors on each side of the vehicle. The windows as tinted shall meet the requirements for AS-3 glazing material established by federal regulation. For purposes of this subsection, a multipurpose passenger vehicle is a motor vehicle with motive power that is designed to carry 10 or fewer persons and is constructed either on a truck chassis or with special features for occasional off-road operation. (5) Tinting material that has a lower light transmittance or produces a lower total light transmittance than permitted in subsection (2)(a) and (c) of this section may be applied to the side and rear windows of a vehicle registered in the name of a person, or the persons legal guardian, if the person has any of the following documents signed by a validly licensed physician or optometrist stating that the person or another person in the persons household has a physical condition requiring window tinting that produces a lower light transmittance than allowed by this section: (a) An affidavit. (b) A prescription. (c) A letter on the practitioners letterhead. (6) The document required by subsection (5) of this section shall be kept in the vehicle and shall be shown to a police officer who inquires about the tint.

(b) Red, gold, yellow, amber or black material. (c) Tinting material that is in liquid preapplication form and is brushed or sprayed on. (9) Each person who installs window tinting material in compliance with this section shall give the person who requested the installation a certificate stating: (a) The name and address of the person who installed the tint; (b) The light transmittance of the tinting material; (c) The light reflectance of the tinting material; and (d) That the total light transmittance through each window with the tinting material applied is not less than 35 percent. (10) The certificate issued under subsection (9) of this section shall be kept in the motor vehicle and shall be shown to a police officer who inquires about the tint.
