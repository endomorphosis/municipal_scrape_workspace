(1) Any person desiring to construct any public swimming pool, public spa pool, public wading pool or bathhouse shall file an application for plan approval with the Oregon Health Authority. (2) The application must be accompanied by a description of the sources of water supply, amount and quality of water available and intended to be used, method and manner of water purification, treatment, disinfection, heating, regulating and cleaning, lifesaving apparatus, and measures to ensure safety of bathers, measures to ensure personal cleanliness of bathers, methods and manner of washing, disinfecting, drying and storing bathing apparel and towels, and all other information and statistics that may be required by the authority. The authority shall either approve or deny the application based upon the plans submitted. (3) After construction, the authority shall cause an inspection to be made of the proposed public swimming pool, public spa pool, public wading pool or bathhouse. If the authority determines that the public swimming pool, public spa pool, public wading pool or bathhouse as constructed complies with the rules of the authority, it shall issue a final approval authorizing the issuance of a license under ORS 448.035. (4) If a public swimming pool, public spa pool, public wading pool or bathhouse is to be owned, operated or maintained by a person for profit, or in conjunction with a travelers accommodation or recreation park, the applicant shall pay the authority a plan review fee of $600. Payment of the plan review fee entitles the applicant to two inspections toward final approval. The authority may not impose any new standards after a second or any subsequent inspection. For any subsequent construction inspection necessary, the applicant shall pay $100 for each inspection.",

(1) Whenever a water system or part thereof presents or threatens to present a public health hazard requiring immediate action to protect the public health, safety and welfare, the Director of the Oregon Health Authority may request the district attorney of the county wherein the system is located to institute an action. The action may be commenced without the necessity of prior administrative procedures or hearing and entry of an order or at any time during such administrative proceedings, if such proceedings have been commenced. The action may petition for a mandatory injunction compelling the water supplier to cease and desist operation or to make such improvements and corrections as are necessary to remove the public health hazard or threat thereof. (2)(a) If the water supplier refuses to comply with the order of the court, in addition to other remedies, the court may appoint a special master to operate the water system. Costs of operation and improvement during operation by the special master are to be charged to the water supplier and may be collected by impounding revenue due to the water supplier from customers of the supplier; or, if those funds are insufficient, from other revenues due to the water supplier. (b) The court may require sale of a water system under a special master to a responsible party if the water supplier refuses to comply with the standards and requirements of the Oregon Health Authority. (3) Cases filed under provisions of this section or any appeal therefrom shall be given preference on the docket over all other civil cases except those given an equal preference by statute. (4) Nothing in this section is intended to prevent the maintenance of actions for legal or equitable remedies relating to private or public nuisance or for recovery of damages brought by private persons or by the state on relation of any person.",

The Legislative Assembly finds that an agreement between this state and the federal government to assume primary enforcement responsibility in this state for the federal Safe Drinking Water Act is in the best interest of this state, subject to the following assumptions: (1) The federal government provides an annual program grant in an amount no less than that allocated for the state in the 1984 fiscal year. (2) The federal government provides technical assistance to this state, as requested, in emergency situations and during outbreaks of waterborne diseases. (3) The federal government must negotiate an annual work plan for the Oregon Health Authority that can be accomplished within the amount of program grant funding available. (4) The authority adopts standards no less stringent than the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. (5) The authority provides engineering assistance through regional offices in at least four geographically distributed areas in this state. (6) In cooperation with representatives of local health departments, the authority develops an equitable formula for distribution of available funds to support local health department water programs. (7) The primacy agreement may be canceled by the authority, upon 90 days notice, if at any time the federal requirements exceed the amount of federal funding and the cancellation is approved by the legislative review agency as defined in ORS 291.371 (1). (8) The federal government can impose financial sanctions against this state if the state fails to meet the objectives of the annual negotiated work plan without reasonable explanation by tying the next annual funding to specific state production and by withholding of funds a possibility if continued unexplained failures occur but no sanction exists to interfere with other types of federal funding in this state. (9) The federal government may seek to enforce the safe drinking water standards if this state fails to take timely compliance action against a public water system that violates such standards. (10) Enforcement under subsection (9) of this section may be by injunctive relief or, in the case of willful violation, civil penalties authorized by 42 U.S.C. 300g-3(a) and (b).",
