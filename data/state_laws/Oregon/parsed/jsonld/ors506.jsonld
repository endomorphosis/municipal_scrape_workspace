It is the policy of the State of Oregon that food fish shall be managed to provide the optimum economic, commercial, recreational and aesthetic benefits for present and future generations of the citizens of this state. In furtherance of this policy, the goals of food fish management are: (1) To maintain all species of food fish at optimum levels in all suitable waters of the state and prevent the extinction of any indigenous species. (2) To develop and manage the lands and waters of this state in a manner that will optimize the production, utilization and public enjoyment of food fish. (3) To permit an optimum and equitable utilization of available food fish. (4) To develop and maintain access to the lands and waters of the state and the food fish resources thereon. (5) To regulate food fish populations and the utilization and public enjoyment of food fish in a manner that is compatible with other uses of the lands and waters of the state and provides optimum commercial and public recreational benefits. (6) To preserve the economic contribution of the sports and commercial fishing industries in a manner consistent with sound food fish management practices. (7) To develop and implement a program for optimizing the return of Oregon food fish for Oregons recreational and commercial fisheries.",
