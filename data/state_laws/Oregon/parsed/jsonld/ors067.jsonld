(2) A partners duty of loyalty to the partnership and the other partners includes the following: (a) To account to the partnership and hold for it any property, profit or benefit derived by the partner in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business or derived from a use by the partner of partnership property, including the appropriation of a partnership opportunity; (b) Except as provided in subsections (5) and (6) of this section, to refrain from dealing with the partnership in a manner adverse to the partnership and to refrain from representing a person with an interest adverse to the partnership, in the conduct or winding up of the partnership business; and (c) To refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership business before the dissolution of the partnership. (3) A partners duty of care to the partnership and the other partners in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business is limited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law. (4) A partner shall discharge the duties to the partnership and the other partners under this chapter or under the partnership agreement and exercise any rights consistent with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing. (5) A partner does not violate a duty or obligation under this chapter or under the partnership agreement merely because the partners conduct furthers the partners own interest. (6) A partner may lend money to or transact other business with the partnership, provided that any loan or transaction between a partner and the partnership must be: (a) Fair to the partnership; (b) Authorized by the partnership agreement; or (c) Authorized or ratified by a majority of the disinterested partners or by a number or percentage of partners specified in the partnership agreement, after full disclosure of all material facts. (7) Loans and other transactions between the partnership and a partner are binding on the parties in the same manner as transactions between the partnership and persons who are not partners, subject to other applicable law. (8) This section also applies to a person winding up the partnership business as the personal or legal representative of the last surviving partner as if the person were a partner.",

      "text": "Purchase of dissociated partners interest. (1) If a partner is dissociated from a partnership without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business under ORS 67.290, the partnership shall cause the dissociated partners interest in the partnership to be purchased for a buyout price determined pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. (2) The buyout price of a dissociated partners interest is an amount equal to the fair value of the dissociated partners interest in the partnership on the date of the dissociation. If the dissociated partner has a minority interest in the partnership, the buyout price of the dissociated partners interest shall not be discounted as a result of such minority interest. Interest must be paid from the date of dissociation to the date of payment. (3) Damages for wrongful dissociation under ORS 67.225 (2) and all other amounts owing, whether or not presently due, from the dissociated partner to the partnership, must be offset against the buyout price. Interest must be paid from the date the amount owed becomes due to the date of payment. (4) A partnership shall indemnify a dissociated partner whose interest is being purchased against all partnership liabilities, whether incurred before or after the dissociation, except liabilities incurred by an act of the dissociated partner under ORS 67.255. On application by the partnership or a partner made within 120 days after the date of dissociation, a court may determine that indemnification of the dissociated partner against all partnership liabilities incurred before the dissociation is not equitable based on either: (a) The financial condition of the partnership on the date of dissociation; or (b) The dissolution of the partnership within 60 days after the date of dissociation. (5) If no agreement for the purchase of a dissociated partners interest is reached within 120 days after a written demand for payment, the partnership shall pay, or cause to be paid, in cash to the dissociated partner the amount the partnership estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets and accrued interest under subsection (3) of this section. (6) If a deferred payment is authorized under subsection (8) of this section, the partnership shall tender a written offer to pay the amount it estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets under subsection (3) of this section, stating the time of payment and the other terms and conditions of the obligation. (7) The payment or tender required by subsection (5) or (6) of this section must be accompanied by the following: (a) A statement of partnership assets and liabilities as of the date of dissociation; (b) The latest available partnership balance sheet and income statement, if any; (c) An explanation of how the estimated amount of the payment was calculated; and (d) Written notice that the payment is in full satisfaction of the obligation to purchase unless, within 120 days after the written notice, the dissociated partner commences an action to determine the buyout price, any offsets under subsection (3) of this section or other terms of the obligation to purchase. (8) A partner who wrongfully dissociates before the expiration of a definite term or the completion of a particular undertaking is not entitled to payment of any portion of the buyout price until the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, unless the partner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that earlier payment will not cause undue hardship to the business of the partnership. A deferred payment bears interest but need not be secured unless the dissociated partner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the court that security for the deferred payment is appropriate. (9) A dissociated partner may maintain an action against the partnership, pursuant to ORS 67.160 (3)(b)(B), to determine the buyout price of that partners interest, any offsets under subsection (3) of this section or other terms of the obligation to purchase. The action must be commenced within 120 days after the partnership has tendered payment or an offer to pay, or within one year after written demand for payment if no payment or offer to pay is tendered. The court shall determine the buyout price of the dissociated partners interest and any offset due under subsection (3) of this section and accrued interest, and enter judgment for any additional payment or refund. If deferred payment is authorized under subsection (8) of this section, the court shall also determine whether security for deferred payment is appropriate and the other terms of the obligation to purchase. The court may assess reasonable attorney fees and the fees and expenses of appraisers or other experts for a party to the action, in amounts the court finds equitable, against a party that the court finds acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith. The finding may be based on the partnerships failure to tender payment or an offer to pay or to comply with subsection (7) of this section.",

(2) The partners of a limited liability partnership may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (1) of this section either on: (a) Financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances; or (b) A fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances. (3) For purposes of this section, the amount, if any, by which a liability as to which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the limited liability partnership exceeds the fair value of such specific property shall be disregarded as a liability of the partnership. (4) This section shall not apply to distributions to the partners that are regularly and customarily paid and constitute reasonable compensation for services performed by the partners in the business of the partnership. (5) If a partner receives a distribution in violation of the partnership agreement or this section, the partner is liable to the limited liability partnership for a period of two years after the receipt of such distribution for that portion of the distribution that violates the partnership agreement or this section.
