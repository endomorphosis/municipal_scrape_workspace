The Legislative Assembly further declares that there are areas in the state that need the particular attention of government to help attract private business investment into these areas and to help resident businesses to reinvest and grow and that many local governments wish to have tax incentives and other assistance available to stimulate sound business investments that support and improve the quality of life. Therefore, it is declared to be the purpose of ORS 285C.050 to 285C.250 to stimulate and protect economic success in such areas of the state by providing tax incentives for employment, business, industry and commerce and by providing adequate levels of complementary assistance to community strategies for such interrelated goals as environmental protection, growth management and efficient infrastructure.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1)(c) or (e) of this section, an eligible business firm may meet the qualifications of this section if the firm has satisfied the following requirements: (a) The firm is authorized subject to ORS 285C.155 and the firm satisfies those requirements; and (b)(A) The firm completes an investment of $25 million or more in qualified property; or (B) The firm fulfills the requirements of ORS 285C.205 and the employment of the firm does not decrease below the annual average employment of the firm. (3) An authorized business firm that engages in both eligible and ineligible operations in an enterprise zone and is an eligible business firm because of ORS 285C.135 (3) meets the qualifications of this section if: (a) The eligible operations of the firm under ORS 285C.135 meet the qualifications of this section; and (b) The employees of the firm work a majority of their time in eligible operations within the enterprise zone. (4) A business firm does not meet the qualifications of this section if the firm or any other firm under common control closes or permanently curtails operations in another part of the state more than 30 miles from the nearest boundary of the enterprise zone in which the firm seeks a property tax exemption. This subsection applies to the transfer of any of the business firms eligible operations to the enterprise zone from another part of the state, if the closure or permanent curtailment in the other part of the state diminished employment in the county and more local labor markets after authorization and on or before December 31 of the first tax year for which any qualified property of the firm in that zone would otherwise be exempt under ORS 285C.175. (5) An authorized business firm that moves any of its employees from a site or sites within 30 miles from the nearest boundary of the enterprise zone after authorization may meet the qualifications under this section if the employment of the firm has been increased within the zone and at the site or sites from which the employees were transferred, no later than April 1 preceding the first tax year for which qualified property of the firm is exempt under ORS 285C.175, to not less than 110 percent of the annual average employment of the firm within the zone and the site or sites from which the employees were transferred, calculated over the 12 months preceding the date of application for authorization. (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(f) of this section, the Oregon Business Development Department shall adopt rules that define the effect of noncompliance on an eligible business firms continuing exemption in an enterprise zone and that indicate what is necessary to establish the noncompliance in terms of materiality of the relevant violation, the finality of applicable legal or regulatory proceedings and judgments involving the firm, the failure by the firm to perform or submit to remedial or curative actions and similar factors. (7) As used in this section: (a) Annual average employment of the firm means the average employment of the firm, calculated over the 12 months preceding the date of application for authorization. (b) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, employment of the firm means: (A) The number of employees working for the firm a majority of their time in eligible operations at locations throughout the enterprise zone; or (B) In the case of a firm described in ORS 285C.135 (5)(b), the number of employees working a majority of their time at the facility in the enterprise zone for which authorization was obtained.",

The Legislative Assembly finds that the welfare of the residents of the rural Indian reservations of this state is acutely dependent upon the growth, development and expansion of employment and business opportunities within reservation boundaries. Geographic and other obstacles have made it difficult for rural Indian reservations to attract and retain private business investment. The tax systems of this state, by subjecting businesses located within reservation boundaries to state taxation in addition to any taxation imposed by the reservations themselves, has heightened the economic isolation of this states rural reservations and impeded the efforts of Indian tribes to develop sufficient tax bases to fund essential governmental services on their reservations. The Legislative Assembly further finds that it is in the best interests of this state to create equality that will enable rural Indian reservations to attract and retain private business investment. The Legislative Assembly declares that it is the purpose of ORS 285C.300 to 285C.320 to remove the tax disincentives that currently inhibit private business and industry from locating and operating enterprises within the boundaries of the rural Indian reservations of this state.

(2) An application for designation of a rural renewable energy development zone shall be in such form and shall contain such information as the Oregon Business Development Department prescribes by rule. The application shall include a copy of the resolution of the governing body of the city or each county that constitutes the applicant that states that the city or county seeks rural renewable energy development zone designation. (3) The director shall approve designation of the territory of the applicant as a rural renewable energy development zone, excluding any territory of an applicant that is not within a rural area at the time of designation. (4)(a) The designation of an area as a rural renewable energy development zone authorizes the exemption of up to an amount, determined as prescribed in paragraph (d) of this subsection, in real market value of property described in ORS 285C.359 that meets the requirements for exemption under ORS 285C.362.

(d) Each amount authorized for exemption under this section shall be determined as follows: (A) The amount shall be set forth in the resolution described in subsection (2) of this section. (B) If no amount is specified in the resolution described in subsection (2) of this section, the amount shall be $250 million. (C) The amount may not exceed $250 million for any single designation under this section. (D) The amount applies only to exemptions first claimed for a tax year that begins after January 1 following the date of adoption of the resolution described in subsection (2) of this section. (5) If an application for designation was made by one city or county, that city or county shall serve as sponsor of the rural renewable energy development zone. If the application for designation was made by two or more counties, the application shall identify which county shall serve as the sponsor of the zone.",

(c) If the governing body of the city, port or county decides to object to preliminary certification of the firm, the governing body shall adopt a resolution stating its objection and the reason for its objection. (d) The governing body of a city, port or county has 60 days from the date the application is sent to the city, port or county to object to preliminary certification. If the objection is not made within the 60-day period, the city, port or county shall be deemed to have agreed to preliminary certification. (5) When an application is filed under this section, the department shall review the application and determine whether all of the following requirements are met: (a) The proposed facility is to be located at a qualified location.

(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the average wage received by the newly hired employees must equal or exceed 100 percent of the average wage in the county. (e) The business operations of the business firm that are to be conducted at the facility constitute a new business that the firm does not operate at another location in this state. (f) The business operations of the business firm will not compete with existing businesses in the city or county in which the facility is to be located. (6) If the department determines that the proposed facility, if completed as described in the application, meets the criteria set forth in subsection (5) of this section and the governing body of the city, port or county does not object under subsection (4) of this section to preliminary certification of the firm, the department shall issue a preliminary certification to the firm. (7) If the department determines that the proposed facility, as set forth in the application, does not meet the requirements for preliminary certification under this section, the department may not issue a preliminary certification. The applicant may appeal the decision to not issue a preliminary certification in the manner of a contested case under ORS chapter 183. No appeal may be made if the reason for not issuing a preliminary certification is the objection of the governing body of the city, port or county under subsection (4) of this section.",

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the director may certify a lesser amount than the total cost of the facility, or need not certify any amount, if any of the following conditions exist at the time of preliminary certification: (a) The last quarterly economic and revenue forecast for a biennium indicates that moneys available to the General Fund for the next biennium will be at least three percent less than appropriations from the General Fund for the current biennium; (b) A quarterly economic and revenue forecast projects that revenues in the General Fund in the current biennium will be at least two percent below what revenues were projected to be in the revenue forecast on which the legislatively adopted budget, as defined in ORS 291.002, for the current biennium was based; (c) The proposed facility, in the estimate of the director, does not possess the likelihood of success established in criteria of success under ORS 285C.543 (5); (d) The proposed facility, in the estimate of the director, is not likely to increase employment in Oregon to the minimum levels required in rules adopted under ORS 285C.543 (3); (e) The applicant lacks the minimum level of financial viability established in rules adopted under ORS 285C.543 (5); (f) The applicant is unlikely, in the estimate of the director, to base a decision to relocate or expand a facility in Oregon on allowance of the tax credit, given the criteria established in rules under ORS 285C.543 (6); or (g) During a time period listed in section 15, chapter 474, Oregon Laws 2011, the director receives applications for preliminary certification with a total amount of potential tax credits in excess of the limitation for the time period. (3) The director shall determine the dollar amount certified for any facility and the priority between applications for certification based upon the criteria contained in ORS 285C.540 to 285C.559 and applicable rules and standards adopted under ORS 285C.540 to 285C.559.

(3) For purposes of this section, for projects located on a federally recognized Oregon Indian reservation, the governing body of a county shall be considered to be the governing body of the federally recognized Oregon Indian tribe. (4) The county may not make the request under subsection (1) of this section unless, after a public hearing: (a) The county and, if the proposed eligible project will be located within the boundaries of a city or port, the city or port have entered into an agreement with the business firm, as described in this subsection. The Oregon Business Development Department shall make available, in a timely manner, training materials related to negotiation techniques in such circumstances to the county, city or port, as applicable. (b) The agreement provides for the payment of a fee by the business firm, as follows: (A) The fee shall be for community services support that relates to the direct impact of the eligible project on public services. (B) The fee shall be in an amount equal to 25 percent of the property taxes that would, but for the exemption, be due on the exempt property in each assessment year, but not exceeding $3 million in any year. (C) The fee shall be paid annually during the tax exemption period, as of a date set forth in the agreement. (c) The agreement provides for the refunding or crediting of overpayments, for interest on late payments or underpayments and for the manner in which the appeal of the assessed value of the property included in the project will affect the fee. (5) The maximum fee amount allowed under subsection (4)(b) of this section shall be adjusted each year for the property tax year beginning on July 1 by multiplying $3 million by the ratio of the increase, if any, in the monthly averaged Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, West Region, for the 12 consecutive months ending December 31 of the prior calendar year over the monthly averaged index for the 12 consecutive months ending December 31, 2023.

(b) If an effective agreement is not entered into under paragraph (a) of this subsection within three months after the date of the determination by the commission under ORS 285C.606 (1), the commission shall, by official action, establish a formula for distributing the fee collected under subsection (4)(b) of this section.

(1) A county seeking to ensure that all eligible projects constructed or installed within a particular geographic area within the county receive the tax exemption under ORS 307.123 may request designation of the geographic area as a strategic investment zone. The request must be made by official action of the governing body of the county taken at a regular or duly called special meeting of the governing body by the affirmative vote of a majority of members of the governing body. The request must set forth the proposed boundaries of the zone. (2) The governing body of the county shall forward appropriate actions requesting zone establishment to the Oregon Business Development Department for consideration by the Oregon Business Development Commission. If the commission determines that the proposed zone is likely to achieve the purpose set forth in ORS 285C.603 and other objectives established for the zone by the requesting county, the department or the commission, the commission shall designate the geographic area a strategic investment zone. (3) Any eligible project described in ORS 285C.606 (3) and newly constructed or installed after the date of zone designation under this section shall qualify for exemption under ORS 307.123 if the business firm benefited by the eligible project complies with the fee agreement described in subsection (4) of this section. (4) The county may not make the request under subsection (1) of this section unless, after a public hearing: (a) The county and, if the proposed zone will be located within a city or port, the city or port have entered into an agreement described in this subsection. (b) The agreement provides for the payment of a fee by each business firm that is to own or operate an eligible project within the proposed zone, as a condition for the exemption under ORS 307.123. The agreement shall provide for the payment of the fee, as follows: (A) The fee shall be for community services support that relates to the direct impact of the eligible project on public services. (B) The fee shall be in an amount equal to 25 percent of the property taxes that would, but for the exemption, be due on the exempt property in each assessment year, but not exceeding $2 million per eligible project in any year or, if the eligible project is located in a rural area, $500,000 per eligible project in any year. (C) The fee shall be paid annually during the tax exemption period by each business firm having an eligible project within the zone, as of a date set forth in the agreement. (c) The agreement provides for the refunding or crediting of overpayments, for interest on late payments or underpayments and for the manner in which the appeal of the assessed value of the property included in the project will affect the fee. (5) The agreement described in subsection (4) of this section may provide for any other requirements that each business firm must comply with in order for the eligible project of the firm to qualify for exemption under ORS 307.123. (6)(a) The fee collected under subsection (4)(b) of this section shall be distributed by the county based on an additional agreement described in this subsection. An agreement described in this subsection is effective only if: (A) The county and the city or port, if any, in which the eligible project is located have entered into the agreement; and (B) Local taxing districts listed in ORS 198.010 or 198.180, other than ports, that constitute at least 75 percent of the property tax authority of all local taxing districts listed in ORS 198.010 or 198.180, other than ports, that are in the code area in which the eligible project is located have entered into the agreement. (b) If an additional agreement is not entered into under paragraph (a) of this subsection within three months after the date of the determination by the commission under ORS 285C.606 (1), the commission shall, by official action, establish a formula for distributing the fee collected under subsection (4)(b) of this section. (7)(a) A county may not enter into an agreement under subsection (4) of this section for designation of a strategic investment zone on or after September 24, 2023. (b) A strategic investment zone designated on the basis of an agreement entered into under subsection (4) of this section before September 24, 2023, may continue to operate in accordance with the terms of this section in effect on the date on which the agreement was entered into.",

If the qualified community development entity fails to provide the information or complete its application within the 15-day period, the application remains denied and must be resubmitted in full with a new submission date. (3) If the application is deemed complete, the department shall certify the proposed equity investment or long-term debt security as a qualified equity investment and eligible for a tax credit under ORS 315.533, subject to the limitations in ORS 315.536.

(4)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, within 60 days after receiving notice of certification, a qualified community development entity shall issue the qualified equity investment and receive cash in the amount of the certified purchase price. The qualified community development entity must provide the department with evidence of the receipt of the cash investment within 10 business days after receipt. (b) For a qualified equity investment described in ORS 285C.653 (2), a qualified community development entity shall issue the qualified equity investment during the period beginning July 1, 2012, and ending 60 days after receiving notice of certification. If the qualified equity investment is issued prior to the submission of an application for certification under this section, the qualified community development entity must provide the department with evidence of the qualified equity investment and of receipt of the cash investment at the time of application for certification.

Applications received on the same day shall be deemed to have been received simultaneously. For applications received on the same day and deemed complete, the department shall certify, consistent with remaining tax credit capacity, qualified equity investments in proportionate percentages based upon the ratio of the amount of qualified equity investment requested in an application to the total amount of qualified equity investments requested in all applications received on the same day.
