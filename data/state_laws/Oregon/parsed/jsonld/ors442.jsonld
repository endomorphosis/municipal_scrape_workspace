(2) Problems preventing the priority in subsection (1) of this section from being attained include: (a) The inability of many citizens to pay for necessary health care, being covered neither by private insurance nor by publicly funded programs such as Medicare and Medicaid; (b) Rising costs of medical care which exceed substantially the general rate of inflation; (c) Insufficient price competition in the delivery of health care services that would provide a greater cost consciousness among providers, payers and consumers; (d) Inadequate incentives for the use of less costly and more appropriate alternative levels of health care; (e) Insufficient or inappropriate use of existing capacity, duplicated services and failure to use less costly alternatives in meeting significant health needs; and (f) Insufficient primary and emergency medical care services in medically underserved areas of the state. (3) As a result of rising health care costs and the concern expressed by health care providers, health care users, third-party payers and the general public, there is an urgent need to abate these rising costs so as to place the cost of health care within reach of all Oregonians without affecting the quality of care. (4) To foster the cooperation of the separate industry forces, there is a need to compile and disseminate accurate and current data, including but not limited to price and utilization data, to meet the needs of the people of Oregon and improve the appropriate usage of health care services. (5) It is the purpose of this chapter to establish area-wide and state planning for health services, staff and facilities in light of the findings of subsection (1) of this section and in furtherance of health planning policies of this state. (6) It is further declared that hospital costs should be contained through improved competition between hospitals and improved competition between insurers and through financial incentives on behalf of providers, insurers and consumers to contain costs. As a safety net, it is the intent of the Legislative Assembly to monitor hospital performance. [Formerly 442.025]",

(1) Any new hospital or new skilled nursing or intermediate care service or facility not excluded pursuant to ORS 441.065 shall obtain a certificate of need from the Oregon Health Authority prior to an offering or development. (2) The authority shall adopt rules specifying criteria and procedures for making decisions as to the need for the new services or facilities. (3)(a) An applicant for a certificate of need shall apply to the authority on forms provided for this purpose by authority rule. (b) An applicant shall pay a fee prescribed as provided in this section. Subject to the approval of the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, the authority shall prescribe application fees, based on the complexity and scope of the proposed project. (4)(a) The authority shall issue a draft recommendation in response to an application for a certificate of need. (b) The authority may establish an expedited review process for an application for a certificate of need to rebuild a long term care facility, relocate buildings that are part of a long term care facility or relocate long term care facility bed capacity from one long term care facility to another. The authority shall issue a draft recommendation not later than 120 days after the date a complete application subject to expedited review is received by the authority. (5)(a) An applicant or any affected person who is dissatisfied with the draft recommendation of the authority is entitled to an informal hearing before the authority in the course of review and before a proposed decision is rendered. Following an informal hearing, or if no applicant or affected person requests an informal hearing within a period of time prescribed by the authority by rule, the authority shall issue a proposed decision. (b) An applicant or affected person is entitled to a contested case hearing in accordance with ORS chapter 183 to challenge the proposed decision of the authority. Following a contested case hearing, or if no applicant or affected person requests a contested case hearing within a period of time prescribed by the authority by rule, the authority shall issue a final order granting, with or without limitations, or denying the certificate of need. (6) Once a certificate of need has been granted, it may not be revoked or rescinded unless it was acquired by fraud or deceit. However, if the authority finds that a person is offering or developing a project that is not within the scope of the certificate of need, the authority may limit the project as specified in the granted certificate of need or reconsider the application. A certificate of need is not transferable. (7) Nothing in this section applies to any hospital, skilled nursing or intermediate care service or facility that seeks to replace equipment with equipment of similar basic technological function or an upgrade that improves the quality or cost-effectiveness of the service provided. Any person acquiring such replacement or upgrade shall file a letter of intent for the project in accordance with the rules of the authority if the price of the replacement equipment or upgrade exceeds $1 million. (8) Except as required in subsection (1) of this section for a new hospital or new skilled nursing or intermediate care service or facility not operating as a Medicare swing bed program, nothing in this section requires a rural hospital as defined in ORS 442.470 (6)(a)(A) and (B) to obtain a certificate of need. (9) Nothing in this section applies to basic health services, but basic health services do not include: (a) Magnetic resonance imaging scanners; (b) Positron emission tomography scanners; (c) Cardiac catheterization equipment; (d) Megavoltage radiation therapy equipment; (e) Extracorporeal shock wave lithotriptors; (f) Neonatal intensive care; (g) Burn care; (h) Trauma care; (i) Inpatient psychiatric services; (j) Inpatient chemical dependency services; (k) Inpatient rehabilitation services; (L) Open heart surgery; or (m) Organ transplant services. (10) In addition to any other remedy provided by law, whenever it appears that any person is engaged in, or is about to engage in, any acts that constitute a violation of this section, or any rule or order issued by the authority under this section, the authority may institute proceedings in the circuit courts to enforce obedience to such statute, rule or order by injunction or by other processes, mandatory or otherwise. (11) As used in this section, basic health services means health services offered in or through a hospital licensed under ORS chapter 441, except skilled nursing or intermediate care nursing facilities or services and those services specified in subsection (9) of this section.",

(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a hospital licensed under ORS 441.025, in accordance with rules adopted by the Oregon Health Authority, may apply for waiver from the provisions of ORS 442.325, and the authority shall grant the waiver if, for the most recently completed hospital fiscal year preceding the date of application for waiver and each succeeding fiscal year thereafter, the percentage of qualified inpatient revenue is not less than that described in subsection (2) of this section. (2)(a) The percentage of qualified inpatient revenue for the first year in which a hospital is granted a waiver under subsection (1) of this section may not be less than 60 percent. (b) The percentage in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be increased by five percentage points in each succeeding hospital fiscal year until the percentage of qualified inpatient revenue equals or exceeds 75 percent. (3) As used in this section: (a) Qualified inpatient revenue means revenue earned from public and private payers for inpatient hospital services approved by the authority pursuant to rules, including: (A) Revenue earned pursuant to Title XVIII, United States Social Security Act, when such revenue is based on diagnostic related group prices that include capital-related expenses or other risk-based payment programs as approved by the authority; (B) Revenue earned pursuant to Title XIX, United States Social Security Act, when such revenue is based on diagnostic related group prices that include capital-related expenses; (C) Revenue earned under negotiated arrangements with public or private payers based on all-inclusive per diem rates for one or more hospital service categories; (D) Revenue earned under negotiated arrangements with public or private payers based on all-inclusive per discharge or per admission rates related to diagnostic related groups or other service or intensity-related measures; (E) Revenue earned under arrangements with one or more health maintenance organizations; or (F) Other prospectively determined forms of inpatient hospital reimbursement approved in advance by the authority in accordance with rules. (b) Percentage of qualified inpatient revenue means qualified inpatient revenue divided by total gross inpatient revenue as defined by administrative rule of the authority. (4)(a) The authority shall hold a hearing to determine the cause if any hospital granted a waiver pursuant to subsection (1) of this section fails to reach the applicable percentage of qualified inpatient revenue in any subsequent fiscal year of the hospital. (b) If the authority finds that the failure was without just cause and that the hospital has undertaken projects that, except for the provisions of this section, would have been subject to ORS 442.325, the authority shall impose one of the penalties outlined in paragraph (c) of this subsection. (c)(A) A one-time civil penalty of not less than $25,000 or more than $250,000; or (B) An annual civil penalty equal to an amount not to exceed 110 percent of the net profit derived from such project or projects for a period not to exceed five years. (5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a hospital to develop a new inpatient hospital facility or provide new services authorized by facilities defined as long term care facility under ORS 442.015 under a waiver granted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section.

      "text": "Health Care Cost Growth Target program established; rules. (1) The Legislative Assembly intends to establish a health care cost growth target, for all providers and payers, to: (a) Support accountability for the total cost of health care across all providers and payers, both public and private; (b) Build on the states existing efforts around health care payment reform and containment of health care costs; and (c) Ensure the long-term affordability and financial sustainability of the health care system in this state. (2) The Health Care Cost Growth Target program is established. The program shall be administered by the Oregon Health Authority in collaboration with the Department of Consumer and Business Services, subject to the oversight of the Oregon Health Policy Board. The program shall establish a health care cost growth target for increases in total health expenditures and shall review and modify the target on a periodic basis. (3) The health care cost growth target must: (a) Promote a predictable and sustainable rate of growth for total health expenditures as measured by an economic indicator adopted by the board, such as the rate of increase in this states economy or of the personal income of residents of this state; (b) Apply to all providers and payers in the health care system in this state; (c) Use established economic indicators; and (d) Be measurable on a per capita basis, statewide basis and health care entity basis. (4) The program shall establish a methodology for calculating health care cost growth: (a) Statewide; (b) For each provider and payer, taking into account the health status of the patients of the provider or the beneficiary of the payer; and (c) Per capita. (5)(a) The program shall establish requirements for providers and payers to report data and other information necessary to calculate health care cost growth under subsection (4) of this section. (b) Based on a methodology determined by the authority, each provider shall report annually the providers aggregate amount of total compensation. (6) Annually, the program shall: (a) Hold public hearings on the growth in total health expenditures in relation to the health care cost growth in the previous calendar year; (b) Publish a report on health care costs and spending trends that includes: (A) Factors impacting costs and spending; and (B) Recommendations for strategies to improve the efficiency of the health care system; and (c) For providers and payers for which health care cost growth in the previous calendar year exceeded the health care cost growth target: (A) Analyze the cause for exceeding the health care cost growth target; and (B) Require the provider or payer to develop and undertake a performance improvement plan. (7)(a) The authority shall adopt by rule criteria for waiving the requirement for a provider or payer to undertake a performance improvement plan, if necessitated by unforeseen market conditions or other equitable factors. (b) The authority shall collaborate with a provider or payer that is required to develop and undertake a performance improvement plan by: (A) Providing a template for performance improvement plans, guidelines and a time frame for submission of the plan; (B) Providing technical assistance such as webinars, office hours, consultation with technical assistance providers or staff, or other guidance; and (C) Establishing a contact at the authority who can work with the provider or payer in developing the performance improvement plan. (8) A performance improvement plan must: (a) Identify key cost drivers and include concrete steps a provider or payer will take to address the cost drivers; (b) Identify an appropriate time frame by which a provider or payer will reduce the cost drivers and be subject to an evaluation by the authority; and (c) Have clear measurements of success. (9) The authority shall adopt by rule criteria for imposing a financial penalty on any provider or payer that exceeds the cost growth target without reasonable cause in three out of five calendar years or on any provider or payer that does not participate in the program. The criteria must be based on the degree to which the provider or payer exceeded the target and other factors, including but not limited to: (a) The size of the provider or payer organization; (b) The good faith efforts of the provider or payer to address health care costs; (c) The providers or payers cooperation with the authority or the department; (d) Overlapping penalties that may be imposed for failing to meet the target, such as requirements relating to medical loss ratios; and (e) A providers or payers overall performance in reducing cost across all markets served by the provider or payer. (10) A provider shall not be accountable for cost growth resulting from the providers total compensation. [2019 c.560 2; 2021 c.51 2; 2023 c.393 2] Note: Section 7, chapter 51, Oregon Laws 2021, provides: Sec. 7. A financial penalty described in ORS 442.386 (9), as amended by section 2 of this 2021 Act, may be imposed no earlier than January 1, 2026, for performance by a provider or payer in meeting cost growth targets during calendar years 2021 to 2025.

      "text": "(Temporary provisions relating to primary care payment reform collaborative) Note: Sections 2 to 5, chapter 575, Oregon Laws 2015, provide: Sec. 2. (1) As used in this section: (a) Carrier means an insurer that offers a health benefit plan, as defined in ORS 743B.005. (b) Coordinated care organization has the meaning given that term in ORS 414.025. (c) Primary care means family medicine, general internal medicine, naturopathic medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics or general psychiatry. (d) Primary care provider includes: (A) A physician, naturopath, nurse practitioner, physician assistant or other health professional licensed or certified in this state, whose clinical practice is in the area of primary care. (B) A health care team or clinic that has been certified by the Oregon Health Authority as a patient centered primary care home. (2)(a) The Oregon Health Authority shall convene a primary care payment reform collaborative to advise and assist in the implementation of a Primary Care Transformation Initiative to: (A) Use value-based payment methods that are not paid on a per claim basis to: (i) Increase the investment in primary care; (ii) Align primary care reimbursement by all purchasers of care; and (iii) Continue to improve reimbursement methods, including by investing in the social determinants of health; (B) Increase investment in primary care without increasing costs to consumers or increasing the total cost of health care; (C) Provide technical assistance to clinics and payers in implementing the initiative; (D) Aggregate the data from and align the metrics used in the initiative with the work of the Health Plan Quality Metrics Committee established in ORS 413.017; (E) Facilitate the integration of primary care behavioral and physical health care; and (F) Ensure that the goals of the initiative are met by December 31, 2027. (b) The collaborative is a governing body, as defined in ORS 192.610. (3) The authority shall invite representatives from all of the following to participate in the primary care payment reform collaborative: (a) Primary care providers; (b) Health care consumers; (c) Experts in primary care contracting and reimbursement; (d) Independent practice associations; (e) Behavioral health treatment providers; (f) Third party administrators; (g) Employers that offer self-insured health benefit plans; (h) The Department of Consumer and Business Services; (i) Carriers; (j) A statewide organization for mental health professionals who provide primary care; (k) A statewide organization representing federally qualified health centers; (L) A statewide organization representing hospitals and health systems; (m) A statewide professional association for family physicians; (n) A statewide professional association for physicians; (o) A statewide professional association for nurses; and (p) The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. (4) The primary care payment reform collaborative shall annually report to the Oregon Health Policy Board and to the Legislative Assembly on the achievement of the primary care spending targets in ORS 414.625 [renumbered 414.572] and 743.010 and the implementation of the Primary Care Transformation Initiative. (5) A coordinated care organization shall report to the authority, no later than October 1 of each year, the proportion of the organizations total medical costs that are allocated to primary care. (6) The authority, in collaboration with the Department of Consumer and Business Services, shall adopt rules prescribing the primary care services for which costs must be reported under subsection (5) of this section. [2015 c.575 2; 2017 c.384 1; 2017 c.489 13] Sec. 3. No later than February 1 of each year, the Oregon Health Authority and the Department of Consumer and Business Services shall report to the Legislative Assembly, in the manner provided in ORS 192.245: (1) The percentage of the medical expenses of carriers, coordinated care organizations, the Public Employees Benefit Board and the Oregon Educators Benefit Board that is allocated to primary care; and (2) How carriers, coordinated care organizations, the Public Employees Benefit Board and the Oregon Educators Benefit Board pay for primary care. [2015 c.575 3; 2016 c.26 7] Sec. 4. (1) The Legislative Assembly declares that collaboration among insurers, purchasers and providers of health care to coordinate service delivery systems and develop innovative reimbursement methods in support of integrated and coordinated health care delivery is in the best interest of the public. The Legislative Assembly therefore declares its intent to exempt from state antitrust laws, and to provide immunity from federal antitrust laws through the state action doctrine, the activities specified in section 2 (2) of this 2015 Act, of the participants in the primary care payment reform collaborative, that might otherwise be constrained by such laws. (2) The Director of the Oregon Health Authority or the directors designee shall engage in state supervision of the primary care payment reform collaborative to ensure that the activities and discussions of the participants in the collaborative are limited to the activities described in section 2 (2) of this 2015 Act. (3) Groups that include, but are not limited to, health insurance companies, health care centers, hospitals, health service organizations, employers, health care providers, health care facilities, state and local governmental entities and consumers may meet to facilitate the development, implementation and operation of the Primary Care Transformation Initiative in accordance with section 2 of this 2015 Act. (4) The Oregon Health Authority may conduct a survey of the entities and individuals specified in subsection (3) of this section to assist in the evaluation of the Primary Care Transformation Initiative. (5) A survey or meeting under subsection (3) or (4) of this section is not a violation of state antitrust laws and shall be considered state action for purposes of federal antitrust laws through the state action doctrine. [2015 c.575 4] Sec. 5. (1) Sections 1 to 4, chapter 575, Oregon Laws 2015, are repealed on December 31, 2027. (2) Section 3, chapter 489, Oregon Laws 2017, is repealed on December 31, 2027. (3) The amendments to section 8 of this 2022 Act [743B.221] by section 14 of this 2022 Act become operative on December 31, 2027.

(1) As used in this section: (a) Financial assistance includes: (A) Charity care, as defined in ORS 442.601; or (B) An adjustment to a patients costs for care under ORS 442.614 (1)(a). (b) Hospital has the meaning given that term in ORS 442.612. (2) Using the process prescribed by the Oregon Health Authority under subsection (3) of this section, a hospital licensed under ORS 441.025 shall screen a patient for presumptive eligibility for financial assistance if the patient: (a) Is uninsured; (b) Is enrolled in the state medical assistance program; or (c) Owes the hospital more than $500. (3) The authority shall adopt by rule the process for screening a patient for presumptive eligibility for financial assistance under subsection (2) of this section. The rules and process must: (a) Prohibit a hospital from requiring a patient to provide documentation or other verification; (b) Ensure that the process will not cause any negative impact on the patients credit score; (c) Require a hospital, before sending a bill to the patient, to conduct the screening and apply any financial assistance for which the patient qualifies to the bill; and (d) Require the hospital to notify a patient if the patient has been screened and to explain to the patient, in language approved by the authority, how to apply for financial assistance if financial assistance was denied, or how to apply for additional financial assistance above what the patient received. (4) A patient may apply for financial assistance: (a) If the patient was screened for presumptive eligibility for financial assistance and was found not to be eligible or the patient disagrees with the amount of the financial assistance that was offered; (b) If a patient was not screened for presumptive eligibility for financial assistance; or (c) Any time up to 12 months after a patient pays for the services that the hospital provided. (5) A hospital may require a patient who applies for financial assistance under subsection (4) of this section to provide documentation or verification of information reported as necessary for the hospital to determine the patients eligibility for financial assistance. (6) If a patient applies for financial assistance after having paid for the services and the patient is found to have been eligible for financial assistance when the services were provided: (a) The hospital shall refund the amount of financial assistance for which the patient qualified; (b) If the hospital previously determined, incorrectly, that the patient did not qualify for financial assistance for the services based on information provided by the patient at the time of the incorrect determination, the hospital shall also pay the patient interest on the amount of financial assistance at the rate set by the Federal Reserve and any other associated reasonable costs, such as legal expenses and fees, incurred by the patient in securing financial assistance; and (c) If the hospital sold the debt to a collection agency or authorized a collection agency to collect debts on behalf of the hospital, the hospital shall notify the collection agency that the debt is invalid. (7) If a patient applies for financial assistance and the hospital determines that the patient is eligible for financial assistance based on documentation provided by the patient, the patients eligibility for financial assistance continues for nine months following the hospitals determination, and the patient may not be required to reapply for financial assistance for services provided during that nine-month period. (8)(a) A hospital must have a written process that is in plain English, and in other languages as required by law, for a patient to appeal a hospitals denial of financial assistance, in whole or in part, and that allows the patient, or an individual acting on behalf of the patient, to correct any deficiencies in documentation or to request a review of the denial by the hospitals chief financial officer or the chief financial officers designee. The authority shall prescribe by rule the requirements for the appeal process. (b) If a hospital denies a patients application for financial assistance, whether in whole or in part, the hospital must notify the patient of the denial and include in the notice an explanation of the hospitals appeal process. (9) During the pendency of an appeal that is filed using a hospitals appeal process under subsection (8) of this section, if: (a) The hospital has initiated collection activities, the hospital must suspend all collection activities; and (b) The hospital sold the debt under appeal to a collection agency or has authorized a collection agency to collect debts on behalf of the hospital, the hospital must notify the collection agency to suspend collection activities.

(2) The Legislative Assembly declares that, to the extent provided in ORS 442.700 to 442.760, it is the policy and intent of this state to displace competition among health care providers providing heart and kidney transplant services by allowing health care providers to enter into cooperative programs governing the provision of heart and kidney transplant services in order to achieve in each instance the following goals: (a) Reduction of, or protection against, rising costs of heart and kidney transplant services; (b) Reduction of, or protection against, rising prices for heart and kidney transplant services; (c) Improvement or maintenance of the quality of heart and kidney transplant services provided in this state; (d) Reduction of, or protection against, duplication of resources including, without limitation, expensive medical specialists, medical equipment and sites of service; (e) Improvement or maintenance of efficiency in the delivery of heart and kidney transplant services; (f) Improvement or maintenance of public access to heart and kidney transplant services; (g) Increase in donations of organs for transplantation; and (h) Improvement in the continuity of patient care.

(4) The Legislative Assembly further declares that once a cooperative program is approved under ORS 442.700 to 442.760, there is an interest in insuring stability in the provision of health care services by a cooperative program, to the extent stability is consistent with achieving the goals identified in subsection (2) of this section.

(b) If the director determines that the cooperative program is engaging in unlawful activity not permitted by the order or is not complying with the directive given under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the director may serve on the cooperative program a proposed order directing the cooperative program to: (A) Conform with the directive under paragraph (a) of this subsection; or (B) Cease and desist from engaging in the activity. (2) The cooperative program shall have up to 30 days to comply with a proposed order under subsection (1)(b) of this section unless the board of governors demonstrates additional time is needed for compliance. (3) If the director determines that the participants in the cooperative program are in substantial noncompliance with the cease and desist directive, the director may seek an appropriate injunction in the circuit courts of Marion or Multnomah Counties.
