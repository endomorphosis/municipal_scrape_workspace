The purpose of this chapter is to encourage the fullest utilization of the available workforce by removing arbitrary standards of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, marital status, age or disability as a barrier to employment of the inhabitants of this state, and to ensure the human dignity of all people within this state and protect their health, safety and morals from the consequences of intergroup hostility, tensions and practices of unlawful discrimination of any kind based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, marital status, age, disability or familial status. To accomplish this purpose, the Legislative Assembly intends by this chapter to provide: (1) A program of public education calculated to eliminate attitudes upon which practices of unlawful discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, marital status, age, disability or familial status are based. (2) An adequate remedy for persons aggrieved by certain acts of unlawful discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, marital status, disability or familial status, or unreasonable acts of discrimination in employment based upon age. (3) An adequate administrative machinery for the orderly resolution of complaints of unlawful discrimination through a procedure involving investigation, conference, conciliation and persuasion, to encourage the use in good faith of the machinery by all parties to a complaint of unlawful discrimination and to discourage unilateral action that makes moot the outcome of final administrative or judicial determination on the merits of the complaint.",

(1) An employee shall be granted a leave of absence by the employer of the employee to perform active state service if: (a) The employee is a member of the organized militia of this state and is called into active service of the state under ORS 399.065 or 399.075. (b) The employee is a member of the organized militia of another state and is called into active state service by the Governor of the respective state. (2) The employer shall grant the employee a leave of absence until release from active state service permits the employee to resume the duties of employment. The regular employment position of an employee on a leave of absence for active state service under this section is considered vacant only for the period of the leave of absence. The employee is not subject to removal or discharge from the position as a consequence of the leave of absence. (3) Upon the termination of the leave of absence for active state service, an employee shall: (a) Resume the duties of employment within seven calendar days; and (b) Be restored to the employees position or an equivalent position by the employer without loss of seniority, vacation credits, sick leave credits, service credits under a pension plan or any other employee benefit or right that had been earned at the time of the leave of absence. (4) An employer is not required to pay wages or other monetary compensation to an employee during a leave of absence required under subsection (1) of this section. (5) Notwithstanding subsection (4) of this section: (a) The State of Oregon shall continue coverage under an employer-sponsored health plan to an employee of the State of Oregon and any other individual provided coverage under the employees plan on the day before the date the employee goes on leave for a period not exceeding a total of 12 months during a leave of absence required under subsection (1) of this section. (b) An employer other than the State of Oregon may continue coverage under an employer-sponsored health plan to an employee and any other individual provided coverage under the employees plan on the day before the date the employee goes on leave during a leave of absence required under subsection (1) of this section. (6)(a) Notwithstanding subsection (4) of this section, the State of Oregon, a county, a municipality or other political subdivision of this state may establish and administer a donated leave program that: (A) Allows an employee who is on a leave of absence required under subsection (1) of this section to receive donated leave; and (B) Allows an employee to voluntarily donate vacation time to an eligible employee on a leave of absence required under subsection (1) of this section. (b) An employee who is on a leave of absence required under subsection (1) of this section and who receives donated leave under paragraph (a) of this subsection may receive an amount of donated leave that supplements any pay received as a member of the organized militia, but may not receive more than the amount the employee was earning in total compensation on the date the employee began the leave of absence. (7) For the purpose of calculating total compensation under subsection (6) of this section, the State of Oregon, a county, a municipality or other political subdivision of this state shall: (a) Include any amounts attributable to hours of overtime that equal the average number of hours of overtime for the same employee class; (b) Determine the average number of hours of overtime for an employee class based on a reasonable expectation of the average number of hours of overtime employees in that class would perform over the course of a calendar year; and (c) Maintain records of the average number of hours of overtime for each employee class for each calendar year. (8) As used in this section: (a) Active service of the state has the meaning given that term in ORS 396.005. (b) Employee means any individual, other than a copartner of the employer or an independent contractor, who renders personal services in this state to an employer who pays or agrees to pay wages or other compensation to the individual for those services. (c) Employee class means a group of similarly situated employees whose positions have been designated by their employer in a policy or a collective bargaining agreement as having common characteristics. (d) Employer means any person who employs one or more employees in this state. The term includes the State of Oregon or any county, city, district, authority, public corporation or entity and any of their instrumentalities organized and existing under law or charter, but does not include the federal government. (e) Total compensation means the total of an employees base salary, differentials and overtime. [Formerly 399.230; 2013 c.81 28; 2023 c.122 10] Note:",

(2) Activities and functions that are considered major life activities for the purpose of determining if an individual has a disability include but are not limited to: (a) Caring for oneself; (b) Performing manual tasks; (c) Seeing; (d) Hearing; (e) Eating; (f) Sleeping; (g) Walking; (h) Standing; (i) Lifting; (j) Bending; (k) Speaking; (L) Breathing; (m) Learning; (n) Reading; (o) Concentrating; (p) Thinking; (q) Communicating; (r) Working; (s) Socializing; (t) Sitting; (u) Reaching; (v) Interacting with others; (w) Employment; (x) Ambulation; (y) Transportation; (z) Operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to: (A) Functions of the immune system; (B) Normal cell growth; and (C) Digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine and reproductive functions; and (aa) Ability to acquire, rent or maintain property. (3) An individual is substantially limited in a major life activity if the individual has an impairment, had an impairment or is perceived as having an impairment that restricts one or more major life activities of the individual as compared to most people in the general population. An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting. An impairment that substantially limits one major life activity of the individual need not limit other major life activities of the individual. An impairment that is episodic or in remission is considered to substantially limit a major life activity of the individual if the impairment would substantially limit a major life activity of the individual when the impairment is active. Nonetheless, not every impairment will constitute a disability within the meaning of this section. (4) When determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity of an individual, the determination shall be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures, including: (a) Medication; (b) Medical supplies, equipment or appliances; (c) Low vision devices or other devices that magnify, enhance or otherwise augment a visual image, except that ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses or other similar lenses that are intended to fully correct visual acuity or eliminate refractive error may be considered when determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity of an individual; (d) Prosthetics, including limbs and devices; (e) Hearing aids, cochlear implants or other implantable hearing devices; (f) Mobility devices; (g) Oxygen therapy equipment or supplies; (h) Assistive technology; (i) Reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids or services; or (j) Learned behavioral or adaptive neurological modifications. (5) Nothing in subsection (4)(c) of this section authorizes an employer to use qualification standards, employment tests or other selection criteria based on an individuals uncorrected vision unless the standard, test or other selection criteria, as used by the employer, are shown to be job-related for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity.",

The person with a disability or the owner may also bring an action for such damages against the owner of any animal that, without provocation, attacks an assistance animal. The action authorized by this subsection may be brought by the person with a disability or the owner even if the assistance animal was in the custody or under the supervision of another person when the theft or attack occurred. (2) If the theft of or unprovoked attack on an assistance animal described in subsection (1) of this section results in the death of the animal or the animal is not returned or if injuries sustained in the theft or attack prevent the animal from returning to service as an assistance animal, the measure of economic damages shall include, but need not be limited to, the replacement value of an equally trained assistance animal, without any differentiation for the age or the experience of the animal. In addition, the person with a disability or the owner may recover any other costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, costs of temporary replacement assistance services, whether provided by another assistance animal or a person, incurred as a result of the theft of or injury to the animal.

(4) A cause of action does not arise under this section if the person with a disability, the owner or the person having custody or supervision of the assistance animal was committing a criminal or civil trespass at the time of the theft of or attack on the assistance animal. (5) The court shall award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing plaintiff in an action under this section. The court may award reasonable attorney fees and expert witness fees incurred by a defendant who prevails in the action if the court determines that the plaintiff had no objectively reasonable basis for asserting a claim or no objectively reasonable basis for appealing an adverse decision of a trial court.

      "text": "Assistance animals. (1) As used in this section: (a) Assistance animal means a dog or other animal designated by administrative rule that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual. (b) Assistance animal trainee means an animal that is undergoing a course of development and training to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual that directly relate to the disability of the individual. (c) Assistance animal trainer means an individual exercising care, custody and control over an assistance animal trainee during a course of training designed to develop the trainee into an assistance animal. (d) Place of public accommodation means a place of public accommodation as defined in ORS 659A.400. (2) A place of public accommodation or of access to state government services, programs or activities may not: (a) Ask an individual about the nature or extent of a disability that the individual has or may have; (b) Require an individual to provide documentation proving that an animal is an assistance animal or an assistance animal trainee; or (c) Notwithstanding any fee or admission charge imposed for pets, require that a person with a disability or an assistance animal trainer pay a fee or admission charge for an assistance animal or assistance animal trainee. (3) A place of public accommodation or of access to state government services, programs or activities may: (a) Ask whether an animal is required due to a disability; and (b) Ask about the nature of the work or task that an animal is trained to do or perform or is being trained to do or perform, unless it is readily apparent that the animal performs or is being trained to perform work or a task for the benefit of a person with a disability. (4) If a place of public accommodation or of access to state government services, programs or activities customarily charges a person for damages that the person causes to the place, the place may charge a person with a disability or an assistance animal trainer for damages that an assistance animal or assistance animal trainee causes to the place. (5) A person with a disability or an assistance animal trainer must maintain control of an assistance animal or assistance animal trainee. Except as provided in this subsection, control shall be exerted by means of a harness, leash or other tether. If the use of a harness, leash or other tether would interfere with the ability of the animal to do the work or perform the tasks for which the animal is trained or is being trained, control may be exerted by the effective use of voice commands, signals or other means. If an animal is not under control as required in this subsection, a place of public accommodation or of access to state government services, programs or activities may consider the animal to be out of control for purposes of subsection (6) of this section. (6)(a) Except as provided in this subsection, a place of public accommodation or of access to state government services, programs or activities may not deny a person with a disability or an assistance animal trainer the right to be accompanied by an assistance animal or assistance animal trainee in any area of the place that is open to the public or to business invitees. A place of public accommodation or of access to state government services, programs or activities may require a person with a disability or an assistance animal trainer to remove an assistance animal or assistance animal trainee if: (A) The animal is not housebroken; or (B) The animal is out of control and effective action is not taken to control the animal. (b) A place of public accommodation or of access to state government services, programs or activities may impose legitimate requirements necessary for the safe operations of the place of public accommodation or the services, programs or activities. The place of public accommodation or of access to state government services, programs or activities shall ensure that the safety requirements are based on actual risks, not on speculation, stereotypes or generalizations about persons with disabilities. (7) A place of public accommodation or of access to state government services, programs or activities shall make reasonable modifications as necessary to allow an opportunity for a person with a disability who is benefited by the use of an assistance animal to obtain goods, services and the use of the advantages, facilities and privileges of the place or the advantages, facilities and privileges of the state government services, programs or activities. For purposes of this subsection, except as provided in subsections (6) and (8) of this section, in addition to any other applicable accommodation requirement, allowing the presence of the assistance animal is a reasonable modification. (8) If a place of public accommodation or of access to state government services, programs or activities requires a person with a disability to remove an assistance animal under subsection (6) of this section, the place shall give the person with a disability a reasonable opportunity to obtain goods, services and the use of the advantages, facilities and privileges of the place or the advantages, facilities and privileges of the state government services, programs or activities without the assistance animals presence. (9) A place of public accommodation or of access to state government services, programs or activities is not required to provide care or supervision for an assistance animal or assistance animal trainee. (10) The protection granted under this section to a person with a disability or an assistance animal trainer does not invalidate or limit the remedies, rights and procedures of any other federal, state or local laws that provide equal or greater protection of the rights of a person with a disability, an assistance animal trainer or individuals associated with a person with a disability.

(3) A covered employer may request verification for the need for leave for the purpose in ORS 659A.159 (1)(d) to care for a child who requires home care due to the closure of the childs school or child care provider as a result of a public health emergency. A request for verification may include a request for: (a) The name of the child requiring home care; (b) The name of the school or child care provider that is subject to closure; (c) A statement from the employee that no other family member of the child is willing and able to care for the child; and (d) A statement that special circumstances exist that require the employee to provide home care for the child during the day, if the child is older than 14 years of age. (4) Subject to the approval of the health care provider, the employee taking family leave for a serious health condition of the employee or a family member of the employee shall make a reasonable effort to schedule medical treatment or supervision at times that will minimize disruption of the employers operations.",

(1) After returning to work after taking family leave under the provisions of ORS 659A.150 to 659A.186, an eligible employee is entitled to be restored to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced if that position still exists, without regard to whether the employer filled the position with a replacement worker during the period of family leave. If the position held by the employee at the time family leave commenced no longer exists, the employee is entitled to be restored to any available equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay and other terms and conditions of employment. If an equivalent position is not available at the job site of the employees former position, the employer shall offer the employee an equivalent position at a job site located within 50 miles of the job site of the employees former position, if such a position is available. If equivalent positions are available at multiple job sites, the employer shall first offer the employee the position at the job site that is nearest to the job site of the employees former position. (2) Except for employee benefits used during the period of leave, the taking of family leave under ORS 659A.150 to 659A.186 shall not result in the loss of any employment benefit accrued before the date on which the leave commenced. (3) This section does not entitle any employee to: (a) Any accrual of seniority or employment benefits during a period of family leave; or (b) Any right, benefit or position of employment other than the rights, benefits and position that the employee would have been entitled to had the employee not taken the family leave. (4)(a) Before restoring an employee to a position under subsection (1) of this section, an employer may require that the employee receive certification from the employees health care provider that the employee is able to resume work. Certification under this subsection may only be required pursuant to a uniformly applied practice or policy of the employer. (b) This subsection does not affect the ability of an employer to require an employee during a period of family leave to report periodically to the employer on the employees status and on the employees intention to return to work. (5)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, benefits are not required to continue to accrue during a period of family leave unless continuation or accrual is required under an agreement of the employer and the employee, a collective bargaining agreement or an employer policy. (b) If the employee is provided group health insurance, the employee is entitled to the continuation of group health insurance coverage during the period of family leave on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work. If family member coverage is provided to the employee, family member coverage must be maintained during the period of family leave. The employee must continue to make any regular contributions to the cost of the health insurance premiums. (c) Notwithstanding ORS 652.610 (3) and except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, if the employer is required or elects to pay any part of the costs of providing disability, life or other insurance coverage for an employee during the period of family leave that should have been paid by the employee, the employer may deduct from the employees pay such amounts upon the employees return to work until the amount the employer advanced toward the payments is paid. In no event may the total amount deducted for insurance under the provisions of this subsection exceed 10 percent of the employees gross pay each pay period. (6) Notwithstanding ORS 652.610 (3), if the employer pays any part of the costs of health, disability, life or other insurance coverage for an employee under the provisions of subsection (5) of this section, and the employee does not return to employment with the employer after taking family leave, the employer may deduct amounts paid by the employer from any amounts owed by the employer to the employee, or may seek to recover those amounts by any other legal means, unless the employee fails to return to work because of: (a) A continuation, reoccurrence or onset of a serious health condition that would entitle the employee to leave for one of the purposes specified by ORS 659A.159 (1)(b) or (c); or (b) Other circumstances beyond the control of the employee.",

(2) An employer may require an employee to disclose any user name and password, password or other means for accessing an account provided by, or on behalf of, the employer or to be used on behalf of the employer. (3) An employer may not be held liable for the failure to request or require an employee or applicant to disclose the information specified in subsection (1)(a) of this section. (4) Nothing in this section prevents an employer from: (a) Conducting an investigation, without requiring an employee to provide a user name and password, password or other means of authentication that provides access to a personal social media account of the employee, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with applicable laws, regulatory requirements or prohibitions against work-related employee misconduct based on receipt by the employer of specific information about activity of the employee on a personal online account or service.

(c) Complying with state and federal laws, rules and regulations and the rules of self-regulatory organizations. (5) Nothing in this section prohibits an employer from accessing information available to the public about the employee or applicant that is accessible through an online account.

(2)(a) Whenever an employer and a former, current or prospective employee enter into an agreement, the terms of which release a claim brought against the employer by an employee alleging the occurrence of unlawful conduct described in subsection (1)(a) and (b) of this section, the agreement may include one or more of the following provisions only when the employee who is a party to the agreement requests the inclusion of such provisions in the agreement: (A) A provision described in subsection (1) of this section; (B) A provision that prevents the disclosure of the amount of or fact of any settlement; or (C) A no-rehire provision that prohibits the employee from seeking reemployment with the employer as a term or condition of the agreement. (b) It is a violation of this subsection for an employer or former employer to: (A) Make an offer of settlement conditional upon a request to include in the agreement the provisions described in paragraph (a) of this subsection. (B) Fail to provide a person with whom the employer seeks to enter into the agreement a copy of the policy described in ORS 659A.375.

(b) The agreement may not become effective until after the revocation period has expired.

(5) An employee may file a complaint under ORS 659A.820 for violations of this section and may bring a civil action under ORS 659A.885 and recover a civil penalty of up to $5,000 and relief as provided by ORS 659A.885 (1) to (3). (6) This section does not apply to an employee who is tasked by law to receive confidential or privileged reports of discrimination, sexual assault or harassment. (7) Except to the extent provided under subsections (2) and (4) of this section, provisions included in an agreement in violation of this section are void and unenforceable. (8) Nothing in this section prohibits an employer from enforcing a nondisclosure or nondisparagement agreement that is unrelated to the conduct described in subsection (1) of this section. (9) As used in this section, sexual assault means unwanted conduct of a sexual nature that is inflicted upon a person or compelled through the use of physical force, manipulation, threat or intimidation.",

This paragraph does not prevent a person from refusing to lease or rent real property to a prospective renter or prospective lessee: (A) Based upon the past conduct of a prospective renter or prospective lessee provided the refusal to lease or rent based on past conduct is consistent with local, state and federal law, including but not limited to fair housing laws; or (B) Based upon the prospective renters or prospective lessees inability to pay rent, taking into account the value of the prospective renters or prospective lessees local, state and federal housing assistance, provided the refusal to lease or rent based on inability to pay rent is consistent with local, state and federal law, including but not limited to fair housing laws. (b) Expel a purchaser from any real property.

(j) Otherwise make unavailable or deny a dwelling to a person. (3)(a) A person whose business includes engaging in residential real estate related transactions may not discriminate against any person in making a transaction available, or in the terms or conditions of the transaction, because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, marital status, familial status or source of income. (b) As used in this subsection, residential real estate related transaction means any of the following: (A) The making or purchasing of loans or providing other financial assistance: (i) For purchasing, constructing, improving, repairing or maintaining a dwelling; or (ii) Secured by residential real estate; or (B) The selling, brokering or appraising of residential real property.

(5) A person may not, for profit, induce or attempt to induce any other person to sell or rent any dwelling by representations regarding the entry or prospective entry into the neighborhood of a person or persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, marital status, familial status or source of income. (6) This section does not apply with respect to sex distinction, discrimination or restriction if the real property involved is such that the application of this section would necessarily result in common use of bath or bedroom facilities by unrelated persons of opposite sex. (7)(a) This section does not apply to familial status distinction, discrimination or restriction with respect to housing for older persons. (b) As used in this subsection, housing for older persons means housing: (A) Provided under any state or federal program that is specifically designed and operated to assist elderly persons, as defined by the state or federal program; (B) Intended for, and solely occupied by, persons 62 years of age or older; or (C) Intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit. Housing qualifies as housing for older persons under this subparagraph if: (i) At least 80 percent of the dwellings are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit; and (ii) Policies and procedures that demonstrate an intent by the owner or manager to provide housing for persons 55 years of age or older are published and adhered to. (c) Housing does not fail to meet the requirements for housing for older persons if: (A) Persons residing in the housing as of September 13, 1988, do not meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(B) or (C) of this subsection. However, new occupants of the housing shall meet the age requirements of paragraph (b)(B) or (C) of this subsection; or (B) The housing includes unoccupied units that are reserved for occupancy by persons who meet the age requirements of paragraph (b)(B) or (C) of this subsection.

(8) The provisions of subsection (2)(a) to (d) and (f) of this section that prohibit actions based upon sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or familial status do not apply to the renting of space within a single-family residence if the owner actually maintains and occupies the residence as the owners primary residence and all occupants share some common space within the residence. (9) Any violation of this section is an unlawful practice.",
