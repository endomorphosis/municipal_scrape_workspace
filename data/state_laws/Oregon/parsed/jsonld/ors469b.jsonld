(5)(a) To be eligible to claim a rebate on behalf of a customer under this section, a contractor that constructs or installs a solar electric system or a paired solar and storage system must, at the time of the construction or installation: (A) Hold any license, bond, insurance or permit required to sell and construct or install the solar electric system or paired solar and storage system; and (B) Meet any other certification requirements set forth in rules adopted by the department. (b) Pursuant to the procedures for a contested case under ORS chapter 183, the Director of the State Department of Energy may deny or revoke a contractors eligibility to claim a rebate on behalf of a customer under this section if the director finds that: (A) The contractors eligibility was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation by the contractor; (B) The contractors performance for installation of solar electric systems or paired solar and storage systems does not meet industry standards; or (C) The contractor has misrepresented to customers either the program established under this section or the nature or quality of the solar electric systems or paired solar electric systems for which rebates are available. (6) Prior to commencing installation of a solar electric system or paired solar and storage system, a contractor must apply to the department to reserve a rebate on behalf of the customer for whom the solar electric system or paired solar and storage system will be installed. (7) To claim a rebate reserved under subsection (6) of this section, the contractor that reserved the rebate must submit to the department verification of the purchase, construction or installation of the solar electric system or paired solar and storage system. The verification required by this section shall be made on a form provided by the department and shall contain: (a) The location of the solar electric system or paired solar and storage system; (b) A description of the solar electric system or paired solar and storage system; (c) Evidence that the contractor that constructed or installed the solar electric system or paired solar and storage system has any license, bond, insurance or permit and meets any other certification requirements required for the sale and construction or installation of the solar electric system or paired solar and storage system; (d) A statement signed by both the contractor and the customer for whom the solar electric system or paired solar and storage system is installed that the customer has received the full value of the rebate as a reduction in the net cost of the purchase, construction or installation of the system and that the rebate was clearly reflected on an invoice provided to the customer; and (e) Any other information that the department determines is necessary. (8)(a) Pursuant to the procedures for a contested case under ORS chapter 183, the director may order the revocation of a rebate or portion of a rebate made under this section if the director finds that: (A) The rebate was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation; or (B) The rebate was obtained by mistake or miscalculation. (b) As soon as the order of revocation under this subsection becomes final, the department immediately shall proceed to recover the rebate or portion of the rebate that is the subject of the order of revocation. All moneys provided to a contractor attributable to the fraudulently or mistakenly obtained rebate or portion of the rebate shall be forfeited. [2019 c.655 2] Sec. 3. (1) The Rooftop Solar Incentive Fund is established in the State Treasury, separate and distinct from the General Fund. Moneys in the Rooftop Solar Incentive Fund shall consist of: (a) Amounts donated to the fund; (b) Amounts appropriated or otherwise transferred to the fund by the Legislative Assembly; and (c) Other amounts deposited into the fund from any public or private source. (2) Moneys in the fund are continuously appropriated to the State Department of Energy to be used to issue rebates pursuant to section 2 of this 2019 Act and to pay the costs and expenses of the department related to the administration and implementation of sections 1 to 4 of this 2019 Act. (3) Over the course of a calendar year, no more than 50 percent of moneys available for issuing rebates from the fund may be used to issue rebates for solar electric systems or paired solar and storage systems constructed or installed for nonresidential customers.
