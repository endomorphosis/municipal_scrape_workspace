      "text": "Short title; policy statement. The purpose of this chapter, which shall be known as the State Pesticide Control Act and shall be enforced by the State Department of Agriculture, is to regulate in the public interest the formulation, distribution, storage, transportation, application and use of pesticides. Many materials have been discovered or synthesized which are necessary and valuable for the control of insects, plant diseases and weeds. Many more pesticides will be discovered and needed. Such materials, however, may injure health, property, wildlife or environment by being distributed, stored, transported, applied or used in an improper or careless manner. The pesticide industry of this state has achieved and maintained high standards in its formulation and use of pesticides while at the same time experiencing a minimum of injury to persons, property or the environment. Currently updating the law to maintain this achievement and to consider future new pesticides and problems is necessary for the protection of persons, property, wildlife and environment of this state. [Formerly 634.012]",

(1) A pesticide operators license, or supplements thereto, shall authorize the licensee to engage in one or more of the classes of pest control or pesticide application business prescribed by the State Department of Agriculture under ORS 634.306 (2). The department may not issue a pesticide operator license to the United States, the State of Oregon or federal, state or local agencies, instrumentalities, political subdivisions, counties, cities, towns, municipal corporations, irrigation, drainage or other districts, other federal, state or local governmental bodies or an Indian tribe. (2) During a license period, and after a person has been issued a license to engage in certain classes of pest control or pesticide application business during a license period, the department upon receiving an additional application and applicable fees, may authorize the licensee to engage in additional classes of pest control or pesticide application business for the remainder of the license period as prescribed in ORS 634.306 (2). (3)(a) The department shall establish a pesticide operator license fee not to exceed $90 for the first class of pest control or pesticide application business as prescribed in ORS 634.306 (2) and not to exceed $15 for each additional class. (b) After a person makes first application for a specific license period, if later during the same license period the person desires to engage in additional classes of pest control or pesticide application businesses, such person shall pay the fee for each additional class established by the department not to exceed $20. (4) At least one owner or part owner of the pest control or pesticide application business shall also obtain and maintain a pesticide applicators license if the pesticide operator is a sole proprietorship or a partnership. At least one officer or employee shall obtain and maintain a pesticide applicators license if the pesticide operator is a corporation. If a pesticide operator is found to be in violation of this subsection, the pesticide operators license, notwithstanding ORS chapter 183, is automatically suspended until the pesticide operator is in compliance. If the business is owned by one individual, the department shall make no charge for the pesticide applicator license issued to the individual under ORS 634.122. (5) The department shall not issue or renew a pesticide operators license until the applicant or licensee has furnished evidence to the department, in the form of a public liability policy issued by an insurance company qualified to do business in Oregon, protecting the applicant or licensee against liability for injury or death to persons and loss of or damage to property resulting from the application of pesticides, or in lieu of a policy, has furnished a deposit of cash, surety bond or other evidence of financial responsibility acceptable to the department that may be applied by the department to the payment of damages resulting from operator liability. However: (a) Except as required under paragraph (b) of this subsection, the financial responsibility required by this section shall not apply to damages or injury to crops or real or personal property being worked upon by the applicant. (b) If the applicant or licensee is to be engaged in the business of controlling or eradicating structural pests, or pests within a public or private place, or pests within private or public places where food is served, prepared or processed or where persons are regularly housed, the financial responsibility required by this section shall apply to damages or injury to real or personal property being worked upon, as well as all the other real and personal property set forth in this section. (6) The financial responsibility required by subsection (5) of this section must be not less than $25,000 for bodily injury to one or more persons and not less than $25,000 for property damage. (7) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS chapter 183, if the licensed pesticide operator fails to maintain the financial responsibility required by subsections (5) and (6) of this section, the license is automatically suspended until the department again verifies the pesticide operator is in compliance with subsections (5) and (6) of this section. The liability insurance company shall notify the department in writing at least 30 days prior to any cancellation of an insurance policy required by this section.

(2) If a governing body has control over only part of a building, a structure or property where a campus is located, the governing body may limit an integrated pest management plan to those parts of the building, structure or property over which the governing body exerts substantial control. (3) A governing body is not required to adopt an integrated pest management plan for off-campus buildings, structures or property, notwithstanding any incidental use for instruction.

      "text": "Written notice requirements; warning signs; failure to notify or warn. (1) The governing body responsible for a school shall adopt policies and processes for ensuring that the integrated pest management plan coordinator for the school, or a designee of the coordinator, gives written notice of a proposed pesticide application at the campus to, at a minimum, parents and guardians of minor students, adult students, school administrators, faculty members and staff members. The plan coordinator or designee may give a written notice described in this subsection by any reasonable means, including but not limited to, electronic mail. (2) In adopting policies and processes under subsection (1) of this section, the governing body shall consider the age of the students attending the school and consider which methods for transmitting notice are most likely to reach the intended recipients. (3) Except as provided in this subsection, the plan coordinator or designee must give a pesticide application notice in a manner reasonably calculated to reach the intended recipient at least 24 hours before the pesticide application occurs. A notice must identify the name, trademark or type of pesticide products, the registration number assigned to each of the pesticide products, the expected area of application, the expected date of application and the reason for the application. If a pest emergency makes it impracticable to give a pesticide application notice at least 24 hours before the pesticide application occurs, the plan coordinator or designee shall send the notice no later than 24 hours after the application occurs. (4) Except as provided in this subsection, if a pesticide is applied at a campus, the plan coordinator or a designee of the coordinator shall place warning signs around pesticide application areas beginning no later than 24 hours before the application occurs and ending no earlier than 72 hours after the application occurs. A warning sign must bear the words Warning: pesticide-treated area, give the expected or actual date and time for the application and provide the telephone number of a contact person. If a pest emergency makes it impracticable to place the warning signs at least 24 hours before the pesticide application, the plan coordinator or designee shall place the signs as soon as practicable but no later than at the time the application occurs. (5) Failure to give notice or post warnings as required by this section does not create a cause of action for damages and may not be asserted as the basis for a per se negligence claim.",
