(1) Notwithstanding provisions of the Insurance Code that require insurers to file rates and policy forms with the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, and except as provided in subsections (3), (4) and (5) of this section, an insurer is exempt from the requirement to file with the director rates or policy forms for the classes of insurance specified in subsection (2) of this section. (2)(a) The following classes of insurance are subject to the exemption described in subsection (1) of this section: (A) Surety insurance; (B) Wet marine and transportation insurance; (C) Boiler and machinery insurance; (D) Environmental impairment and pollution insurance; (E) Kidnap and ransom insurance; (F) Political risk or expropriation insurance; (G) Insurance for property with these characteristics: (i) The owner or property manager demonstrates a willingness and determination to reduce the probability of a loss; (ii) The owner or property manager conducts periodic and thorough specialized inspections and engineering for the purpose of preventing or minimizing loss; (iii) The property has an insurable value sufficient for an insurer to charge a premium in an amount that warrants providing specialized inspection and engineering services; (iv) The property has a structural design and degree of protection that, in combination with specialized inspection and engineering services, has the effect of reducing the need for or importance of publicly provided fire protection; (v) The propertys construction uses fire resistant or incombustible heavy timber or similar materials that are well preserved and in good repair; (vi) The property has fire protection or loss prevention equipment in all areas in which fire prevention or loss protection is necessary; (vii) The owner or property manager provides security and alarm service or equivalent security services or equipment where necessary; and (viii) Sufficient numbers of hydrants, hoses and equipment, an adequate water supply and other components of a private or publicly provided fire protection system exist to protect the propertys exterior; and (H) Commercial lines insurance that the director exempts, other than coverage specified in subsection (4) of this section, for large commercial policyholders that pay an annual aggregate premium threshold amount or that meet other requirements the director specifies. (b) An exemption for the classes of insurance described in paragraph (a) of this subsection applies whether the insurer provides the insurance as a stand-alone policy, as an endorsement or as part of other insurance coverage. (3) Notwithstanding provisions of the Insurance Code that require insurers to file rates and policy forms with the director, and except as provided in subsections (4) and (5) of this section, the director by rule may exempt or amend the rate and form filing requirements for any commercial line of insurance if the director determines that: (a) The requirement is not desirable or is not necessary to protect the public; and (b) An exemption or amendment would enhance competition. (4) The following classes of insurance are not exempt under subsection (1) of this section: (a) Workers compensation insurance; (b) Medical malpractice liability insurance; (c) Commercial automobile liability insurance; (d) Coverage that an insurer issues under an assigned risk plan or through a residual market pool or residual market facility; and (e) Insurance for a project, as defined in ORS 737.602. (5) This section does not apply to any class or line of insurance that an insurer transacts with a consumer, as defined in ORS 746.600. (6)(a) The director may publish a sample disclosure notice that an insurer may issue without needing to file the disclosure with the director for review or approval if the insurer issues the disclosure together with an insurance policy that is a claims-made insurance policy or a liability insurance policy that includes defense costs within the limits of liability. (b) An insurer need not use the sample disclosure notice described in paragraph (a) of this subsection. An insurer that does not use the sample disclosure notice shall file the insurers proposed notice with the director for review and approval. If the director approves the insurers proposed notice, the insurer may issue the notice with all of the insurers claims-made insurance policies or policies that include defense costs within the limits of liability without submitting the notice to the director for further review or approval.

(2) If the premium notice sent by an assuming insurer to a policyholder or a certificate holder described in ORS 742.156 satisfies the requirements of this subsection, payment of any premium to the assuming insurer during the 12-month period after the notice is received constitutes the policyholders acceptance of the transfer to the assuming insurer. Upon such a payment, a novation is effected. The premium notice must state that payment of the premium to the assuming insurer constitutes acceptance of the transfer and must provide a method for the policyholder to pay the premium while reserving the right to reject the transfer.

(4) If a policyholder responds to the notice of transfer by mail, receipt of the response by the transferring insurer occurs on the date the response is postmarked. If a policyholder responds to the notice of transfer by facsimile or other electronic transmission or by registered mail, express delivery or courier service, receipt of the response by the transferring insurer occurs on the date of actual receipt by the transferring insurer.

In determining the 90 percent limitation, the full amount of a line of credit to be secured by a junior lien shall be considered the amount of the loan.

In computing the aggregate amount of insured obligations under ORS 731.516, only the percent of the coverage net of reinsurance shall be included in the aggregate amount. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, the mortgage insurer may elect to insure a portfolio of loans secured by instruments constituting a junior lien on real estate, provided that the total amount at risk in any one portfolio shall not at any time exceed 20 percent of the original principal mortgage loans insured. (c) In lieu of acquiring title to the property securing an obligation to which this subsection applies and paying the entire obligation, the mortgage insurer may elect to pay its coverage percent of the obligation. (4) A mortgagor shall not be required to pay, directly or indirectly, the cost of mortgage insurance on a loan secured by a junior lien when the indebtedness evidencing that loan, combined with all existing mortgage loan amounts at the time the loan is made, is less than 60 percent of the fair market value of the real estate at the time the junior loan is made.

      "text": "Uninsured motorist coverage; underinsurance coverage. (1) Every motor vehicle liability policy that insures against a loss that a natural person suffers and that results from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death that arises out of owning, maintaining or using a motor vehicle shall provide in the policy or by indorsement on the policy uninsured motorist coverage if the policy is either: (a) Issued for delivery in this state; or (b) Issued or delivered by an insurer that does business in this state with respect to any motor vehicle then principally used or principally garaged in this state. (2)(a) A motor vehicle bodily injury liability policy must have the same limits for uninsured motorist coverage as for bodily injury liability coverage unless a named insured in writing elects lower limits. The insured may not elect limits lower than the amounts prescribed to meet the requirements of ORS 806.070 for bodily injury or death. Uninsured motorist coverage must include underinsurance coverage for bodily injury or death caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle with motor vehicle liability insurance that provides recovery in an amount that is less than the sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises out of owning, maintaining or using an uninsured vehicle. Underinsurance coverage must be equal to the sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises out of owning, maintaining or using an uninsured vehicle up to the limits of the uninsured motorist coverage. (b) If a named insured elects lower limits, the named insured shall sign a statement to elect lower limits within 60 days after the time the named insured makes the election. The statement must acknowledge that a named insured was offered uninsured motorist coverage with the limits equal to those for bodily injury liability. The statement must have a brief summary that is not part of the insurance contract and that describes what uninsured motorist coverage provides and what the underinsured coverage provides. The summary must also state the price for coverage with limits equal to the named insureds bodily injury liability limits and the price for coverage with the lower limits the named insured requested. The statement remains in force until a named insured rescinds the statement in writing or until the motor vehicle bodily injury liability limits are changed. The Department of Consumer and Business Services shall approve the form of statement that complies with this paragraph. (c) A statement electing lower limits need not be signed if vehicles are either added to or subtracted from a policy or if the policy is amended, renewed, modified or replaced by the same insurer or an insurer within a group of companies that is under common ownership or control, unless the liability limits of the policy are changed. (3) The insurer that issues the policy may offer one or more options of uninsured motorist coverage that are larger than the amounts prescribed to meet the requirements of ORS 806.070 and in excess of the limits provided under the policy for motor vehicle bodily injury liability insurance. Offers of uninsured motorist coverage must include underinsurance coverage for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises out of owning, maintaining or using a motor vehicle with motor vehicle liability insurance that provides recovery in an amount that is less than the sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises out of owning, maintaining or using an uninsured vehicle. Underinsurance coverage must be equal to the sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises from owning, maintaining or using an uninsured vehicle up to the limits of the uninsured motorist coverage. (4) Underinsurance coverage is subject to ORS 742.504 and 742.542. (5) Uninsured motorist coverage and underinsurance coverage must provide coverage for bodily injury or death if the amount of liability insurance recovered is less than the sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises out of owning, maintaining or using an uninsured vehicle. (6) Uninsured motorist coverage and underinsurance coverage must provide coverage for bodily injury or death if the amount recovered from a self-insurer is less than the sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises out of owning, maintaining or using an uninsured vehicle. (7) As used in this section and except as otherwise provided in this subsection, amount recovered from other motor vehicle liability insurance policies means the proceeds of liability insurance or the proceeds received from a public body under ORS 30.260 to 30.300 that are recovered by or on behalf of the injured party. Proceeds recovered on behalf of the injured party include proceeds the injured partys insurer receives as reimbursement for personal injury protection benefits the insurer provides to the injured person, proceeds the medical providers of the injured person receive and proceeds received as attorney fees on the claim of the injured person. If applicable liability insurance policy limits are exhausted upon payment, settlement or judgment by division among two or more injured persons, amount recovered from other motor vehicle liability insurance policies means the proceeds that are recovered by or on behalf of the injured person but does not include any proceeds of the liability policy that other injured persons receive.",

      "text": "Required provisions of uninsured motorist coverage. Every policy required to provide the coverage specified in ORS 742.502 shall provide uninsured motorist coverage that in each instance is no less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary than if the following provisions were set forth in the policy. However, nothing contained in this section requires the insurer to reproduce in the policy the particular language of any of the following provisions: (1)(a) Notwithstanding ORS 30.260 to 30.300, the insurer will pay all sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured vehicle because of bodily injury sustained by the insured caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the uninsured vehicle. Determination as to whether the insured, the insureds heirs or the insureds legal representative is legally entitled to recover such damages, and if so, the amount thereof, shall be made by agreement between the insured and the insurer, or, in the event of disagreement, may be determined by arbitration as provided in subsection (10) of this section. (b) No judgment against any person or organization alleged to be legally responsible for bodily injury, except for proceedings instituted against the insurer as provided in this policy, shall be conclusive, as between the insured and the insurer, on the issues of liability of the person or organization or of the amount of damages to which the insured is legally entitled. (2) As used in this policy: (a) Bodily injury means bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom. (b) Hit-and-run vehicle means a vehicle that causes bodily injury to an insured arising out of physical contact of the vehicle with the insured or with a vehicle the insured is occupying at the time of the accident, provided: (A) The identity of either the operator or the owner of the hit-and-run vehicle cannot be ascertained; (B) The insured or someone on behalf of the insured reported the accident within 72 hours to a police, peace or judicial officer, to the Department of Transportation or to the equivalent department in the state where the accident occurred, and filed with the insurer within 30 days thereafter a statement under oath that the insured or the legal representative of the insured has a cause or causes of action arising out of the accident for damages against a person or persons whose identities are unascertainable, and setting forth the facts in support thereof; and (C) At the insurers request, the insured or the legal representative of the insured makes available for inspection the vehicle the insured was occupying at the time of the accident. (c) Insured, when unqualified and when applied to uninsured motorist coverage, means: (A) The named insured as stated in the policy and any person designated as named insured in the schedule and, while residents of the same household, the spouse of any named insured and relatives of either, provided that neither the relative nor the spouse is the owner of a vehicle not described in the policy and that, if the named insured as stated in the policy is other than an individual or spouses in a marriage who are residents of the same household, the named insured shall be only a person so designated in the schedule; (B) Any child residing in the household of the named insured if the insured has performed the duties of a parent to the child by rearing the child as the insureds own although the child is not related to the insured by blood, marriage or adoption; and (C) Any other person while occupying an insured vehicle, provided the actual use thereof is with the permission of the named insured. (d) Insured vehicle, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this provision, means: (A) The vehicle described in the policy or a newly acquired or substitute vehicle, as each of those terms is defined in the public liability coverage of the policy, insured under the public liability provisions of the policy; or (B) A nonowned vehicle operated by the named insured or spouse if a resident of the same household, provided that the actual use thereof is with the permission of the owner of the vehicle and the vehicle is not owned by nor furnished for the regular or frequent use of the insured or any member of the same household. (e) Insured vehicle does not include a trailer of any type unless the trailer is a described vehicle in the policy. (f) Occupying means in or upon or entering into or alighting from. (g) Phantom vehicle means a vehicle that causes bodily injury to an insured arising out of a motor vehicle accident that is caused by a vehicle that has no physical contact with the insured or the vehicle the insured is occupying at the time of the accident, provided: (A) The identity of either the operator or the owner of the phantom vehicle cannot be ascertained; (B) The facts of the accident can be corroborated by competent evidence other than the testimony of the insured or any person having an uninsured motorist claim resulting from the accident; and (C) The insured or someone on behalf of the insured reported the accident within 72 hours to a police, peace or judicial officer, to the Department of Transportation or to the equivalent department in the state where the accident occurred, and filed with the insurer within 30 days thereafter a statement under oath that the insured or the legal representative of the insured has a cause or causes of action arising out of the accident for damages against a person or persons whose identities are unascertainable, and setting forth the facts in support thereof. (h) State includes the District of Columbia, a territory or possession of the United States and a province of Canada. (i) Stolen vehicle means an insured vehicle that causes bodily injury to the insured arising out of a motor vehicle accident if: (A) The vehicle is operated without the consent of the insured; (B) The operator of the vehicle does not have collectible motor vehicle bodily injury liability insurance; (C) The insured or someone on behalf of the insured reported the accident within 72 hours to a police, peace or judicial officer or to the equivalent department in the state where the accident occurred; and (D) The insured or someone on behalf of the insured cooperates with the appropriate law enforcement agency in the prosecution of the theft of the vehicle. (j) Sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages means the amount of damages that: (A) A claimant could have recovered in a civil action from the owner or operator at the time of the injury after determination of fault or comparative fault and resolution of any applicable defenses; (B) Are calculated without regard to the tort claims limitations of ORS 30.260 to 30.300; and (C) Are no larger than benefits payable under the terms of the policy as provided in subsection (7) of this section. (k) Uninsured vehicle, except as provided in paragraph (L) of this provision, means: (A) A vehicle with respect to the ownership, maintenance or use of which there is no collectible motor vehicle bodily injury liability insurance, in at least the amounts or limits prescribed for bodily injury or death under ORS 806.070 applicable at the time of the accident with respect to any person or organization legally responsible for the use of the vehicle, or with respect to which there is collectible bodily injury liability insurance applicable at the time of the accident but the insurance company writing the insurance denies coverage or the company writing the insurance becomes voluntarily or involuntarily declared bankrupt or for which a receiver is appointed or becomes insolvent. It shall be a disputable presumption that a vehicle is uninsured in the event the insured and the insurer, after reasonable efforts, fail to discover within 90 days from the date of the accident, the existence of a valid and collectible motor vehicle bodily injury liability insurance applicable at the time of the accident. (B) A hit-and-run vehicle. (C) A phantom vehicle. (D) A stolen vehicle. (E) A vehicle that is owned or operated by a self-insurer: (i) That is not in compliance with ORS 806.130 (1)(c); or (ii) That provides recovery to an insured in an amount that is less than the sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises out of owning, maintaining or using an uninsured vehicle. (L) Uninsured vehicle does not include: (A) An insured vehicle, unless the vehicle is a stolen vehicle; (B) Except as provided in paragraph (k)(E) of this subsection, a vehicle that is owned or operated by a self-insurer within the meaning of any motor vehicle financial responsibility law, motor carrier law or any similar law; (C) A vehicle that is owned by the United States of America, Canada, a state, a political subdivision of any such government or an agency of any such government; (D) A land motor vehicle or trailer, if operated on rails or crawler-treads or while located for use as a residence or premises and not as a vehicle; (E) A farm-type tractor or equipment designed for use principally off public roads, except while actually upon public roads; or (F) A vehicle owned by or furnished for the regular or frequent use of the insured or any member of the household of the insured. (m) Vehicle means every device in, upon or by which any person or property is or may be transported or drawn upon a public highway, but does not include devices moved by human power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks. (3) This coverage applies only to accidents that occur on and after the effective date of the policy, during the policy period and within the United States of America, its territories or possessions, or Canada. (4)(a) This coverage does not apply to bodily injury of an insured with respect to which the insured or the legal representative of the insured shall, without the written consent of the insurer, make any settlement with or prosecute to judgment any action against any person or organization who may be legally liable therefor. (b) This coverage does not apply to bodily injury to an insured while occupying a vehicle, other than an insured vehicle, owned by, or furnished for the regular use of, the named insured or any relative resident in the same household, or through being struck by the vehicle. (c) This coverage does not apply so as to inure directly or indirectly to the benefit of any workers compensation carrier, any person or organization qualifying as a self-insurer under any workers compensation or disability benefits law or any similar law or the State Accident Insurance Fund Corporation. (d) This coverage does not apply with respect to underinsured motorist benefits unless: (A) The limits of liability under any bodily injury liability insurance applicable at the time of the accident regarding the injured person have been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements to the injured person or other injured persons; (B) The described limits have been offered in settlement, the insurer has refused consent under paragraph (a) of this subsection and the insured protects the insurers right of subrogation to the claim against the tortfeasor; (C) The insured gives credit to the insurer for the unrealized portion of the described liability limits as if the full limits had been received if less than the described limits have been offered in settlement, and the insurer has consented under paragraph (a) of this subsection; or (D) The insured gives credit to the insurer for the unrealized portion of the described liability limits as if the full limits had been received if less than the described limits have been offered in settlement and, if the insurer has refused consent under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the insured protects the insurers right of subrogation to the claim against the tortfeasor. (e) When seeking consent under paragraph (a) or (d) of this subsection, the insured shall allow the insurer a reasonable time in which to collect and evaluate information related to consent to the proposed offer of settlement. The insured shall provide promptly to the insurer any information that is reasonably requested by the insurer and that is within the custody and control of the insured. Consent will be presumed to be given if the insurer does not respond within a reasonable time. For purposes of this paragraph, a reasonable time is no more than 30 days from the insurers receipt of a written request for consent, unless the insured and the insurer agree otherwise. (5)(a) As soon as practicable, the insured or other person making claim shall give to the insurer written proof of claim, under oath if required, including full particulars of the nature and extent of the injuries, treatment and other details entering into the determination of the amount payable hereunder. The insured and every other person making claim hereunder shall submit to examinations under oath by any person named by the insurer and subscribe the same, as often as may reasonably be required. Proof of claim shall be made upon forms furnished by the insurer unless the insurer fails to furnish the forms within 15 days after receiving notice of claim. (b) Upon reasonable request of and at the expense of the insurer, the injured person shall submit to physical examinations by physicians, naturopathic physicians, physician assistants or nurse practitioners selected by the insurer and shall, upon each request from the insurer, execute authorization to enable the insurer to obtain medical reports and copies of records. (6) If, before the insurer makes payment of loss hereunder, the insured or the legal representative of the insured institutes any legal action for bodily injury against any person or organization legally responsible for the use of a vehicle involved in the accident, a copy of the summons and complaint or other process served in connection with the legal action shall be forwarded immediately to the insurer by the insured or the legal representative of the insured. (7)(a) The limit of liability stated in the declarations as applicable to each person is the limit of the insurers liability for all damages because of bodily injury sustained by one person as the result of any one accident and, subject to the above provision respecting each person, the limit of liability stated in the declarations as applicable to each accident is the total limit of the companys liability for all damages because of bodily injury sustained by two or more persons as the result of any one accident. (b) Any amount payable under the terms of this coverage because of bodily injury sustained in an accident by a person who is an insured under this coverage shall be reduced by the amount paid and the present value of all amounts payable on account of the bodily injury under any workers compensation law, disability benefits law or any similar law. (c) Any amount payable under the terms of this coverage because of bodily injury sustained in an accident by a person who is an insured under this coverage shall be reduced by the credit given to the insurer pursuant to subsection (4)(d)(C) or (D) of this section. (d) The amount payable under the terms of this coverage may not be reduced by the amount of liability proceeds offered, described in subsection (4)(d)(B) or (D) of this section, that has not been paid to the injured person. If liability proceeds have been offered and not paid, the amount payable under the terms of the coverage shall include the amount of liability limits offered but not accepted due to the insurers refusal to consent. The insured shall cooperate so as to permit the insurer to proceed by subrogation or assignment to prosecute the claim against the uninsured motorist. (8) No action shall lie against the insurer unless, as a condition precedent thereto, the insured or the legal representative of the insured has fully complied with all the terms of this policy. (9)(a) With respect to bodily injury to an insured: (A) While occupying a vehicle owned by a named insured under this coverage, the insurance under this coverage is primary. (B) While occupying a vehicle not owned by a named insured under this coverage, the insurance under this coverage shall apply only as excess insurance over any primary insurance available to the occupant that is similar to this coverage, and this excess insurance coverage shall then apply only to the sums that the insured or the heirs or legal representative of the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury or death that is caused by accident and that arises out of owning, maintaining or using an uninsured vehicle. (b) With respect to bodily injury to an insured while occupying any motor vehicle used as a public or livery conveyance, the insurance under this coverage shall apply only as excess insurance over any other insurance available to the insured that is similar to this coverage, and this excess insurance coverage shall then apply only to the amount by which the applicable limit of liability of this coverage exceeds the sum of the applicable limits of liability of all other insurance. (10) If any person making claim hereunder and the insurer do not agree that the person is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured vehicle because of bodily injury to the insured, or do not agree as to the amount of payment that may be owing under this coverage, then, in the event the insured and the insurer elect by mutual agreement at the time of the dispute to settle the matter by arbitration, the arbitration shall take place as described in ORS 742.505. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, provided, however, that the costs to the insured of the arbitration proceeding do not exceed $100 and that all other costs of arbitration are borne by the insurer. Costs as used in this provision does not include attorney fees or expenses incurred in the production of evidence or witnesses or the making of transcripts of the arbitration proceedings. The person and the insurer each agree to consider themselves bound and to be bound by any award made by the arbitrators pursuant to this coverage in the event of such election. At the election of the insured, the arbitration shall be held: (a) In the county and state of residence of the insured; (b) In the county and state where the insureds cause of action against the uninsured motorist arose; or (c) At any other place mutually agreed upon by the insured and the insurer. (11) In the event of payment to any person under this coverage: (a) The insurer shall be entitled to the extent of the payment to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment that may result from the exercise of any rights of recovery of the person against any uninsured motorist legally responsible for the bodily injury because of which payment is made; (b) The person shall hold in trust for the benefit of the insurer all rights of recovery that the person shall have against such other uninsured person or organization because of the damages that are the subject of claim made under this coverage, but only to the extent that the claim is made or paid herein; (c) If the insured is injured by the joint or concurrent act or acts of two or more persons, one or more of whom is uninsured, the insured shall have the election to receive from the insurer any payment to which the insured would be entitled under this coverage by reason of the act or acts of the uninsured motorist, or the insured may, with the written consent of the insurer, proceed with legal action against any or all persons claimed to be liable to the insured for the injuries. If the insured elects to receive payment from the insurer under this coverage, then the insured shall hold in trust for the benefit of the insurer all rights of recovery the insured shall have against any other person, firm or organization because of the damages that are the subject of claim made under this coverage, but only to the extent of the actual payment made by the insurer; (d) The person shall do whatever is proper to secure and shall do nothing after loss to prejudice such rights; (e) If requested in writing by the insurer, the person shall take, through any representative not in conflict in interest with the person, designated by the insurer, such action as may be necessary or appropriate to recover payment as damages from such other uninsured person or organization, such action to be taken in the name of the person, but only to the extent of the payment made hereunder. In the event of a recovery, the insurer shall be reimbursed out of the recovery for expenses, costs and attorney fees incurred by the insurer in connection therewith; and (f) The person shall execute and deliver to the insurer any instruments and papers as may be appropriate to secure the rights and obligations of the person and the insurer established by this provision. (12)(a) The parties to this coverage agree that no cause of action shall accrue to the insured under this coverage unless within two years from the date of the accident: (A) Agreement as to the amount due under the policy has been concluded; (B) The insured or the insurer has formally instituted arbitration proceedings; (C) The insured has filed an action against the insurer; or (D) Suit for bodily injury has been filed against the uninsured motorist and, within two years from the date of settlement or final judgment against the uninsured motorist, the insured has formally instituted arbitration proceedings or filed an action against the insurer. (b) For purposes of this subsection: (A) Date of settlement means the date on which a written settlement agreement or release is signed by an insured or, in the absence of these documents, the date on which the insured or the attorney for the insured receives payment of any sum required by the settlement agreement. An advance payment as defined in ORS 31.550 shall not be deemed a payment of a settlement for purposes of the time limitation in this subsection. (B) Final judgment means a judgment that has become final by lapse of time for appeal or by entry in an appellate court of an appellate judgment.",

(1)(a) Every motor vehicle liability policy issued for delivery in this state that covers any private passenger motor vehicle shall provide personal injury protection benefits to the person insured thereunder, members of that persons family residing in the same household, children not related to the insured by blood, marriage or adoption who are residing in the same household as the insured and being reared as the insureds own, passengers occupying the insured motor vehicle and pedestrians struck by the insured motor vehicle. (b) A transportation network company shall provide a motor vehicle liability policy with personal injury protection benefits to each driver who operates a personal motor vehicle in affiliation with the transportation network company. (c) A taxi company shall provide a motor vehicle liability policy with personal injury protection benefits to each driver who operates a taxi in affiliation with the taxi company. (d) The personal injury protection benefits described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection must, at all times during which the driver operates the personal motor vehicle or the taxi to provide transportation services to passengers in affiliation with the transportation network company or the taxi company, cover the driver of the personal motor vehicle or taxi, any passengers that occupy the personal motor vehicle or taxi and pedestrians that are struck by the personal motor vehicle or taxi. (e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this subsection, an insurer may exclude from a motor vehicle liability policy for a private passenger motor vehicle any coverage, including personal injury protection benefits, for a loss or injury that occurs while a driver is operating a private passenger motor vehicle to provide transportation services for compensation in affiliation with a transportation network company. (2) Personal injury protection benefits apply to a persons injury or death resulting: (a) In the case of the person insured under the policy and members of that persons family residing in the same household, from the use, occupancy or maintenance of any motor vehicle, except the following vehicles: (A) A motor vehicle, including a motorcycle or moped, that is owned or furnished or available for regular use by any of such persons and that is not described in the policy; (B) A motorcycle or moped which is not owned by any of such persons, but this exclusion applies only when the injury or death results from such persons operating or riding upon the motorcycle or moped; and (C) A motor vehicle not included in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph and, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, not a private passenger motor vehicle. However, this exclusion applies only when the injury or death results from such persons operating or occupying the motor vehicle. (b) In the case of a passenger occupying or a pedestrian struck by the insured motor vehicle, from the use, occupancy or maintenance of the vehicle. (c) In the case of a person insured under the policy who operates a personal motor vehicle or a taxi with which the person provides transportation services to passengers for compensation in affiliation with a transportation network company or a taxi company, from the use, occupancy or maintenance of the personal motor vehicle or taxi. (3) Personal injury protection benefits consist of payments for expenses, loss of income and loss of essential services as provided in ORS 742.524. (4) An insurer shall pay all personal injury protection benefits promptly after proof of loss has been submitted to the insurer. (5) The potential existence of a cause of action in tort does not relieve an insurer from the duty to pay personal injury protection benefits. (6) Disputes between insurers and beneficiaries about the amount of personal injury protection benefits, or about the denial of personal injury protection benefits, shall be decided by arbitration if mutually agreed to at the time of the dispute. Arbitration under this subsection shall take place as described in ORS 742.521. (7) An insurer: (a) May not enter into or renew any contract that provides, or has the effect of providing, managed care services to beneficiaries. (b) May enter into or renew any contract that provides evaluation services for beneficiaries.",

As used in ORS 742.560 to 742.572: (1) Cancellation means termination of coverage by an insurer, other than termination at the request of the insured, during a policy period. (2) Expiration means termination of coverage by reason of the policy having reached the end of the term for which it was issued or the end of the period for which a premium has been paid. (3) Nonpayment of premium means failure of the named insured to discharge when due any of the insureds obligations in connection with the payment of premiums on the policy, or any installment of such premium, whether the premium is payable directly to the insurer or an insurance producer who is its agent or indirectly under any premium finance plan or extension of credit. (4) Nonrenewal means a notice by an insurer to the named insured that the insurer is unwilling to renew a policy. (5) Policy means any insurance policy that provides automobile liability coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, automobile medical payments coverage or automobile physical damage coverage on individually owned private passenger vehicles, including pickup and panel trucks and station wagons, that are not used as a public or livery conveyance for passengers, nor rented to others. However, ORS 742.560 to 742.572 do not apply to any policy: (a) Issued under an automobile assigned risk plan; (b) Insuring more than four automobiles; (c) Covering garage, automobile sales agency, repair shop, service station or public parking place operation hazards; or (d) Issued principally to cover personal or premises liability of an insured even though such insurance may also provide some incidental coverage for liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle on the premises of such insured or on the ways immediately adjoining such premises. (6) Renewal or to renew means to continue coverage for an additional policy period upon expiration of the current policy period of a policy. Any policy with a policy period or term of less than six months shall for the purpose of ORS 742.560 to 742.572 be considered as if written for a policy period or term of six months. Any policy written for a term longer than one year or any policy with no fixed expiration date shall for the purpose of ORS 742.560 to 742.572 be considered as if written for successive policy periods or terms of one year but not extending beyond the actual term for which the policy was written.",

However, the program may not provide liability coverage that is less than three times the limits specified in ORS 806.070. (2) Provide the vehicles registered owner with a proof of compliance with the insurance requirements of this section and the financial or future responsibility requirements of ORS chapter 806, a copy of which must be maintained in the vehicle by the vehicles registered owner at all times when the vehicle is operated by any person other than the vehicles registered owner pursuant to the program. (3) Collect, maintain and make available to the vehicles registered owner, the vehicles registered owners primary motor vehicle liability insurer and any government agency as required by law, at the cost of the program: (a) Verifiable electronic records that identify the date and time, initial and final locations of the vehicle and miles driven when the vehicle is under the control of a person other than the vehicles registered owner pursuant to the program; and (b) Any information concerning damages or injuries arising out of personal vehicle sharing pursuant to the program. (4) Not knowingly permit the vehicle to be operated as a commercial vehicle by a personal vehicle sharing user while engaged in personal vehicle sharing.
