(1) When a principal designates another person as an agent by a power of attorney in writing, and the power of attorney does not contain words that otherwise delay or limit the period of time of its effectiveness: (a) The power of attorney becomes effective when executed and remains in effect until the power is revoked by the principal or by the terms of the power of attorney, or until the authority of all agents under the power of attorney is terminated as provided in ORS 127.015; (b) The powers of the agent are unaffected by the passage of time; and (c) The powers of the agent are exercisable by the agent on behalf of the principal even though the principal becomes financially incapable. (2) The terms of a power of attorney may provide that the power of attorney will become effective at a specified future time, or will become effective upon the occurrence of a specified future event or contingency such as the principal becoming financially incapable. If a power of attorney becomes effective upon the occurrence of a specified future event or contingency, the power of attorney may designate a person or persons to determine whether the specified event or contingency has occurred, and the manner in which the determination must be made. A person designated by a power of attorney to determine whether the principal is financially incapable is the principals personal representative for the purposes of ORS 192.553 to 192.581 and the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act privacy regulations, 45 C.F.R. parts 160 and 164. (3) If a power of attorney becomes effective upon the principal becoming financially incapable and either the power of attorney does not designate a person or persons to make the determination as to whether the principal is financially incapable or none of the designated persons is willing or able to make the determination, a determination that the principal is financially incapable may be made by any physician. The physicians determination must be made in writing. (4) All acts done by an agent under a power of attorney during a period in which the principal is financially incapable have the same effect, and inure to the benefit of and bind the principal, as though the principal were not financially incapable. (5) If a conservator is appointed for a principal, the agent shall account to the conservator, rather than to the principal, for so long as the conservatorship lasts. The conservator has the same power that the principal would have to revoke, suspend or terminate all or any part of the power of attorney. (6) This section does not apply to ORS 127.505 to 127.660.",

      "text": "Form of advance directive. An advance directive executed by an Oregon resident or by a resident of any other state while physically present in this state must be in substantially the following form: ______________________________________________________________________________ OREGON ADVANCE DIRECTIVE FOR HEALTH CARE This Advance Directive form allows you to: Share your values, beliefs, goals and wishes for health care if you are not able to express them yourself. Name a person to make your health care decisions if you could not make them for yourself. This person is called your health care representative and they must agree to act in this role. Be sure to discuss your Advance Directive and your wishes with your health care representative. This will allow them to make decisions that reflect your wishes. It is recommended that you complete this entire form. The Oregon Advance Directive for Health Care form and Your Guide to the Oregon Advance Directive are available on the Oregon Health Authoritys website. In sections 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 you appoint a health care representative. In sections 3 and 4 you provide instructions about your care. The Advance Directive form allows you to express your preferences for health care. It is not the same as Portable Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) as defined in ORS 127.663. You can find more information about the POLST in Your Guide to the Oregon Advance Directive. This form may be used in Oregon to choose a person to make health care decisions for you if you become too sick to speak for yourself or are unable to make your own medical decisions. The person is called a health care representative. If you do not have an effective health care representative appointment and you become too sick to speak for yourself, a health care representative will be appointed for you in the order of priority set forth in ORS 127.635 (2) and this person can only decide to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatments if you meet one of the conditions set forth in ORS 127.635 (1). This form also allows you to express your values and beliefs with respect to health care decisions and your preferences for health care. If you have completed an advance directive in the past, this new advance directive will replace any older directive. You must sign this form for it to be effective. You must also have it witnessed by two witnesses or a notary. Your appointment of a health care representative is not effective until the health care representative accepts the appointment. If your advance directive includes directions regarding the withdrawal of life support or tube feeding, you may revoke your advance directive at any time and in any manner that expresses your desire to revoke it. In all other cases, you may revoke your advance directive at any time and in any manner as long as you are capable of making medical decisions. 1.

(1) Life-sustaining procedures that would otherwise be applied to a principal who is incapable and who does not have an appointed health care representative or applicable valid advance directive may be withheld or withdrawn in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) of this section if the principal has been medically confirmed to be in one of the following conditions: (a) A terminal condition; (b) Permanently unconscious; (c) A condition in which administration of life-sustaining procedures would not benefit the principals medical condition and would cause permanent and severe pain; or (d) An advanced stage of a progressive illness that will be fatal, and the principal is consistently and permanently unable to communicate by any means, to swallow food and water safely, to care for the principals self and to recognize the principals family and other people, and it is very unlikely that the principals condition will substantially improve. (2) If a principals condition has been determined to meet one of the conditions set forth in subsection (1) of this section, and the principal does not have an appointed health care representative or applicable valid advance directive, the principals health care representative shall be the first of the following, in the following order, who can be located upon reasonable effort by the health care facility and who is willing to serve as the health care representative: (a) A guardian of the principal who is authorized to make health care decisions, if any; (b) The principals spouse; (c) An adult designated by the others listed in this subsection who can be so located, if no person listed in this subsection objects to the designation; (d) A majority of the adult children of the principal who can be so located; (e) Either parent of the principal; (f) A majority of the adult siblings of the principal who can be located with reasonable effort; or (g) Any adult relative or adult friend. (3) If none of the persons described in subsection (2) of this section is available, then life-sustaining procedures may be withheld or withdrawn upon the direction and under the supervision of the attending physician or attending health care provider. (4)(a) Life-sustaining procedures may be withheld or withdrawn, including an election for hospice treatment, upon the direction and under the supervision of the attending physician or attending health care provider at the request of a person designated the health care representative under subsections (2) and (3) of this section only after the person has consulted with concerned family and close friends and, if the principal has a case manager, as defined by rules adopted by the Department of Human Services, after giving notice to the principals case manager. (b) A case manager who receives notice under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall provide the person giving the case manager notice with any information in the case managers possession that is related to the principals values, beliefs and preferences with respect to the withholding or withdrawing of life-sustaining procedures. (c) As used in this subsection, hospice treatment means treatment that focuses on palliative care, including care for acute pain and symptom management, rather than curative treatment, provided to a principal with a terminal condition. (5) Before life-sustaining procedures may be withheld or withdrawn for a principal who has an intellectual or developmental disability, the person designated under subsection (2) or (3) of this section shall contact the department to determine if the principal has a case manager and provide notice to the case manager in accordance with subsection (4) of this section. (6) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, a person who is the principals parent or former guardian may not withhold or withdraw life-sustaining procedures under this section if: (a) At any time while the principal was under the care, custody or control of the person, a court entered an order: (A) Taking the principal into protective custody under ORS 419B.150; or (B) Committing the principal to the legal custody of the Department of Human Services for care, placement and supervision under ORS 419B.337; and (b) The court entered a subsequent order that: (A) The principal should be permanently removed from the persons home, or continued in substitute care, because it was not safe for the principal to be returned to the persons home, and no subsequent order of the court was entered that permitted the principal to return to the persons home before the principals wardship was terminated under ORS 419B.328; or (B) Terminated the persons parental rights under ORS 419B.500 and 419B.502 to 419B.524. (7) A principal, while not incapable, may petition the court to remove a prohibition contained in subsection (6) of this section.",

It creates a declaration for mental health treatment. Before signing this document, you should know these important facts: This document allows you to make decisions in advance about certain types of mental health treatment: psychoactive medication, short-term (not to exceed 17 days) admission to a treatment facility, convulsive treatment and outpatient services. Outpatient services are mental health services provided by appointment by licensed professionals and programs. The instructions that you include in this declaration will be followed only if a court or two physicians believe that you are incapable of making treatment decisions. Otherwise, you will be considered capable to give or withhold consent for the treatments. Your instructions may be overridden if you are being held pursuant to civil commitment law. You may also appoint a person as your representative to make treatment decisions for you if you become incapable. The person you appoint has a duty to act consistently with your desires as stated in this document or, if not stated, as otherwise known by the representative. If your representative does not know your desires, he or she must make decisions in your best interests. For the appointment to be effective, the person you appoint must accept the appointment in writing. The person also has the right to withdraw from acting as your representative at any time. A representative is also referred to as an attorney-in-fact in state law but this person does not need to be an attorney at law. This document will continue in effect for a period of three years unless you become incapable of participating in mental health treatment decisions. If this occurs, the directive will continue in effect until you are no longer incapable. You have the right to revoke this document in whole or in part at any time you have not been determined to be incapable. YOU MAY NOT REVOKE THIS DECLARATION WHEN YOU ARE CONSIDERED INCAPABLE BY A COURT OR TWO PHYSICIANS. A revocation is effective when it is communicated to your attending physician or other provider. If there is anything in this document that you do not understand, you should ask a lawyer to explain it to you. This declaration will not be valid unless it is signed by two qualified witnesses who are personally known to you and who are present when you sign or acknowledge your signature. NOTICE TO PHYSICIAN OR PROVIDER Under Oregon law, a person may use this declaration to provide consent for mental health treatment or to appoint a representative to make mental health treatment decisions when the person is incapable of making those decisions. A person is incapable when, in the opinion of a court or two physicians, the persons ability to receive and evaluate information effectively or communicate decisions is impaired to such an extent that the person currently lacks the capacity to make mental health treatment decisions. This document becomes operative when it is delivered to the persons physician or other provider and remains valid until revoked or expired. Upon being presented with this declaration, a physician or provider must make it a part of the persons medical record. When acting under authority of the declaration, a physician or provider must comply with it to the fullest extent possible. If the physician or provider is unwilling to comply with the declaration, the physician or provider may withdraw from providing treatment consistent with professional judgment and must promptly notify the person and the persons representative and document the notification in the persons medical record. A physician or provider who administers or does not administer mental health treatment according to and in good faith reliance upon the validity of this declaration is not subject to criminal prosecution, civil liability or professional disciplinary action resulting from a subsequent finding of the declarations invalidity. ______________________________________________________________________________ [1997 c.563 3 (enacted in lieu of 127.735); 2023 c.11 4] Note: See note under",

Except as provided in ORS 127.890: (1) No person shall be subject to civil or criminal liability or professional disciplinary action for participating in good faith compliance with ORS 127.800 to 127.897. This includes being present when a qualified patient takes the prescribed medication to end his or her life in a humane and dignified manner. (2) No professional organization or association, or health care provider, may subject a person to censure, discipline, suspension, loss of license, loss of privileges, loss of membership or other penalty for participating or refusing to participate in good faith compliance with ORS 127.800 to 127.897. (3) No request by a patient for or provision by an attending physician of medication in good faith compliance with the provisions of ORS 127.800 to 127.897 shall constitute neglect for any purpose of law or provide the sole basis for the appointment of a guardian or conservator. (4) No health care provider shall be under any duty, whether by contract, by statute or by any other legal requirement to participate in the provision to a qualified patient of medication to end his or her life in a humane and dignified manner. If a health care provider is unable or unwilling to carry out a patients request under ORS 127.800 to 127.897, and the patient transfers his or her care to a new health care provider, the prior health care provider shall transfer, upon request, a copy of the patients relevant medical records to the new health care provider. (5)(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a health care provider may prohibit another health care provider from participating in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 on the premises of the prohibiting provider if the prohibiting provider has notified the health care provider of the prohibiting providers policy regarding participating in ORS 127.800 to 127.897. Nothing in this paragraph prevents a health care provider from providing health care services to a patient that do not constitute participation in ORS 127.800 to 127.897. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1) to (4) of this section, a health care provider may subject another health care provider to the sanctions stated in this paragraph if the sanctioning health care provider has notified the sanctioned provider prior to participation in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 that it prohibits participation in ORS 127.800 to 127.897: (A) Loss of privileges, loss of membership or other sanction provided pursuant to the medical staff bylaws, policies and procedures of the sanctioning health care provider if the sanctioned provider is a member of the sanctioning providers medical staff and participates in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 while on the health care facility premises, as defined in ORS 442.015, of the sanctioning health care provider, but not including the private medical office of a physician or other provider; (B) Termination of lease or other property contract or other nonmonetary remedies provided by lease contract, not including loss or restriction of medical staff privileges or exclusion from a provider panel, if the sanctioned provider participates in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 while on the premises of the sanctioning health care provider or on property that is owned by or under the direct control of the sanctioning health care provider; or (C) Termination of contract or other nonmonetary remedies provided by contract if the sanctioned provider participates in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 while acting in the course and scope of the sanctioned providers capacity as an employee or independent contractor of the sanctioning health care provider. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to prevent: (i) A health care provider from participating in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 while acting outside the course and scope of the providers capacity as an employee or independent contractor; or (ii) A patient from contracting with his or her attending physician and consulting physician to act outside the course and scope of the providers capacity as an employee or independent contractor of the sanctioning health care provider. (c) A health care provider that imposes sanctions pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection must follow all due process and other procedures the sanctioning health care provider may have that are related to the imposition of sanctions on another health care provider. (d) For purposes of this subsection: (A) Notify means a separate statement in writing to the health care provider specifically informing the health care provider prior to the providers participation in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 of the sanctioning health care providers policy about participation in activities covered by ORS 127.800 to 127.897. (B) Participate in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 means to perform the duties of an attending physician pursuant to ORS 127.815, the consulting physician function pursuant to ORS 127.820 or the counseling function pursuant to ORS 127.825. Participate in ORS 127.800 to 127.897 does not include: (i) Making an initial determination that a patient has a terminal disease and informing the patient of the medical prognosis; (ii) Providing information about the Oregon Death with Dignity Act to a patient upon the request of the patient; (iii) Providing a patient, upon the request of the patient, with a referral to another physician; or (iv) A patient contracting with his or her attending physician and consulting physician to act outside of the course and scope of the providers capacity as an employee or independent contractor of the sanctioning health care provider. (6) Suspension or termination of staff membership or privileges under subsection (5) of this section is not reportable under ORS 441.820. Action taken pursuant to ORS 127.810, 127.815, 127.820 or 127.825 shall not be the sole basis for a report of unprofessional or dishonorable conduct under ORS 677.415 (3), (4), (5) or (6). (7) No provision of ORS 127.800 to 127.897 shall be construed to allow a lower standard of care for patients in the community where the patient is treated or a similar community.
