(1) On the death of a member of a credit union, if the deposit to the credit of the deceased member is $25,000 or less, the credit union may, upon receipt of an affidavit from a person claiming the deposit as provided in subsection (3) of this section, or a declaration from the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority as provided in subsection (4) of this section, pay the moneys on deposit: (a) To the surviving spouse on demand of the surviving spouse at any time after the death of the member; (b) If there is no surviving spouse, to the Oregon Health Authority or the Department of Human Services, on demand of the authority or the department no less than 46 days and no more than 75 days after the death of the member when there is a preferred claim arising under ORS 411.708, 411.795 or 416.350; (c) If there is no surviving spouse and no authority or department claim, to the members surviving children 18 years of age or older; (d) If there is no surviving spouse, authority claim, department claim or surviving child 18 years of age or older, to the members surviving parents; (e) If there is no surviving spouse, authority claim, department claim, surviving child 18 years of age or older or surviving parent, to the members surviving brothers and sisters 18 years of age or older; or (f) If there is no surviving spouse, authority claim, department claim, surviving child 18 years of age or older, surviving parent or surviving brothers or sisters 18 years of age or older, to any other surviving heir of the member. (2)(a) A credit union may not pay moneys on deposit under subsection (1)(c) to (f) of this section earlier than 46 days after the death of the member. (b) A credit union may not pay moneys on deposit under subsection (1)(c) to (f) of this section earlier than 76 days after the death of the member unless the financial institution obtains prior verbal or written authorization from the Oregon Health Authority or its designated representative and the Department of Human Services or its designated representative. (3) An affidavit or declaration submitted under this section must: (a) State where and when the member died; (b) State that the total deposits of the deceased member in all financial institutions in this state do not exceed $25,000; (c) Show the relationship of the affiant or declarant to the deceased member; and (d) Embody a promise to pay the expenses of last sickness, funeral expenses and just debts of the deceased member out of the deposit, to the full extent of the deposit if necessary, in the order of priority prescribed by ORS 115.125, and to distribute any remaining moneys to the persons who are entitled to those moneys by law. (4) A credit union shall accept from the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority, without additional requirements, a declaration under penalty of perjury meeting the requirements of subsection (3) of this section, provided that the declaration is submitted no earlier than 46 days after the death of the depositor and no later than 76 days after the death of the depositor. A declaration submitted under this section must be signed by the declarant and must include the following sentence immediately above the signature line of the declarant: I hereby declare under penalty of perjury that I am authorized by the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority to make this declaration, that the above statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that I understand that it is subject to penalty for perjury. (5) In the event the member died intestate without known heirs, an estate administrator of the State Treasurer appointed under ORS 113.235 shall be the affiant and shall receive the moneys for deposit into the Unclaimed Property and Estates Fund as escheated property and subject to claims under ORS 116.253. (6) The credit union shall determine the relationship of the affiant or declarant to the deceased member. However, payment of the moneys in good faith to the affiant or declarant discharges and releases the transferor from any liability or responsibility for the transfer in the same manner and with the same effect as if the property had been transferred, delivered or paid to a personal representative of the estate of the deceased member. (7) A probate proceeding is not necessary to establish the right of the surviving spouse, Oregon Health Authority, Department of Human Services, surviving children, surviving parents, surviving brothers and sisters or an estate administrator of the State Treasurer to withdraw the deposits upon the filing of the affidavit or declaration. If a personal representative is appointed in an estate where a withdrawal of deposits was made under this section, the person withdrawing the deposits shall account for them to the personal representative. (8) When a credit union transfers moneys under subsection (1) of this section, the transferor may require the transferee to furnish the transferor with a written indemnity agreement, indemnifying the transferor against loss for moneys paid to the extent of the amount of the deposit. (9)(a) Moneys disbursed to the Department of Human Services under subsection (1) of this section may be made payable only to the department. (b) Moneys disbursed to the Oregon Health Authority under subsection (1) of this section may be made payable only to the authority.

      "text": "Definitions for ORS 723.474 to 723.498. As used in ORS 723.474 to 723.498, unless the context requires otherwise: (1) Account means a contract of deposit of funds between a member and a credit union and includes a checking account, savings account, certificate of deposit and share account. (2) Beneficiary means a person named in a trust account as one for whom a party to the account is named as trustee. (3) Joint account means an account payable on request to one or more of two or more parties whether or not mention is made of any right of survivorship. (4) Multiple-party account means a joint account, a P.O.D. account or a trust account. Multiple-party account does not include: (a) Accounts established for the deposit of funds of a partnership, joint venture or other association for business purposes; or (b) Accounts controlled by one or more persons as the duly authorized agent or trustee for a corporation, unincorporated association, charitable or civic organization, or a regular fiduciary or trust account where the relationship is established other than by deposit agreement. (5) Net contribution of a party to a joint account means the sum of all deposits made to the account by or for the party, less all withdrawals made by or for the party that have not been paid to or applied to the use of any other party, plus a pro rata share of any interest or dividends included in the current balance. Net contribution includes any proceeds of deposit life insurance added to the account by reason of the death of the party whose net contribution is in question. (6) Party means a person who, by the terms of the multiple-party account, has a present right, subject to request, to payment from a multiple-party account. A P.O.D. payee or beneficiary of a trust account is a party only after the account becomes payable to the payee or beneficiary by reason of the payee or beneficiary surviving the original party or trustee. Party includes a guardian, conservator, personal representative or assignee, including an attaching creditor, of a party. Party also includes a person identified as a trustee of an account, whether or not a beneficiary is named, but does not include any named beneficiary unless the named beneficiary has a present right of withdrawal. (7) Payment of sums on deposit includes withdrawal, payment on check or other directive of a party, any pledge of sums on deposit by a party and any setoff, deduction or other disposition of all or part of an account pursuant to a pledge. (8) P.O.D. account means an account payable on request: (a) To one person during the lifetime of the person and upon the death of the person to one or more P.O.D. payees; or (b) To one or more persons during their lifetimes and upon the death of all of them to one or more P.O.D. payees. (9) P.O.D. payee means a person designated on a P.O.D. account as the person to whom the account is payable on request after the death of one or more persons. (10) Request means a proper request for withdrawal, or a check or order for payment, that complies with all conditions of the account, including special requirements concerning necessary signatures and regulations of the credit union. If the credit union conditions withdrawal or payment on advance notice, for purposes of ORS 723.474 to 723.498, the request for withdrawal or payment is treated as immediately effective and a notice of intent to withdraw is treated as a request for withdrawal. (11) Sums on deposit means the balance payable on a multiple-party account including interest, dividends and any deposit life insurance proceeds added to the account by reason of the death of a party. (12) Trust account means an account in the name of one or more parties as trustee for one or more beneficiaries where the relationship is established by the form of the account and the deposit agreement with the credit union, and there is no subject of the trust other than the sums on deposit in the account. It is not essential that payment to the beneficiary be mentioned in the deposit agreement. A trust account does not include a regular trust account under a testamentary trust, a trust agreement that has significance apart from the account, or a fiduciary account arising from a fiduciary relationship such as attorney-client. (13) Withdrawal includes payment to a third person pursuant to check or other directive of a party.",

If there are two or more surviving parties, their respective ownerships during their lifetimes shall be in proportion to their previous ownership interests under ORS 723.478, augmented by an equal share for each survivor of any interest the decedent may have owned in the account immediately before death. The right of survivorship continues between the surviving parties. (2) If the account is a P.O.D. account: (a) Upon the death of one of two or more original parties, the rights to any sums remaining on deposit are governed by subsection (1) of this section. (b) Upon the death of the sole original party or the survivor of two or more original parties, any sums remaining on deposit belong to the P.O.D. payee or payees, if surviving, or to the survivor of them if one or more die before the original party. If two or more P.O.D. payees survive, there is no right of survivorship in the event of death of a P.O.D. payee thereafter unless the terms of the account or deposit agreement expressly provide for survivorship between them. (3) If the account is a trust account: (a) Upon the death of one of two or more trustees, the rights to any sums remaining on deposit are governed by subsection (1) of this section. (b) Upon the death of the sole trustee or the survivor of two or more trustees, any sums remaining on deposit belong to the person or persons named as beneficiaries, if surviving, or to the survivor of them if one or more die before the trustee, unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a contrary intent. If two or more beneficiaries survive, there is no right of survivorship in the event of death of any beneficiary thereafter unless the terms of the account or deposit agreement expressly provide for survivorship between them. (4) In other cases, the death of any party to a multiple-party account has no effect on beneficial ownership of the account, other than to transfer the rights of the decedent as part of the estate of the decedent. (5) A right of survivorship arising under this section or from the express terms of the account, a beneficiary designation in a trust account or a P.O.D. payee designation cannot be changed by will. (6) The rebuttable presumption under subsection (1) of this section may be overcome by evidence establishing that: (a) The deceased party intended a different result; or (b) The deceased party lacked capacity when the joint account was established. (7) A credit union is not liable for distributing sums remaining on deposit at the death of a party to a joint account to a surviving party or parties in accordance with the account agreement unless, prior to distributing sums to a surviving party or parties: (a) The credit union has received notice of an adverse claim under ORS 723.468; and (b) The adverse claimant proceeds as required under ORS 723.468.",

      "text": "Liquidation. (1) A credit union may elect to dissolve voluntarily and liquidate its affairs in the manner prescribed in this section. (2) The board of directors shall adopt a resolution recommending the credit union be dissolved voluntarily and directing that the question of liquidation be submitted to the members. (3) Within 10 days after the board of directors decides to submit the question of liquidation to the members, the president or chairperson of the board shall notify the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services thereof in writing setting forth the reasons for the proposed action. Within 10 days after the members act on the question of liquidation, the president or chairperson of the board shall notify the director in writing as to whether or not the members approved the proposed liquidation. (4) As soon as the board of directors decides to submit the question of liquidation to the members, payment on shares, withdrawal of shares, making any transfer of shares to loans and interest, making investments of any kind and granting loans shall be suspended pending action by members on the proposal to liquidate. On approval by the members of such proposal, all such business transactions shall be permanently discontinued. Necessary expenses of operation shall, however, continue to be paid on authorization of the board of directors or liquidating agent during the period of liquidation. (5) For a credit union to enter voluntary liquidation, approval by a majority of the members in writing or by a two-thirds majority of the members present at a regular or special meeting of the members is required. Where authorization for liquidation is to be obtained at a meeting of the members, notice in writing shall be given to each member by first class mail to the members last-known address at least 10 days prior to such meeting. (6) A liquidating credit union shall continue in existence for the purpose of discharging its debts, collecting and distributing its assets and doing all acts required in order to wind up its business and may sue and be sued for the purpose of enforcing such debts and obligations until its affairs are fully adjusted. (7) The board of directors or the liquidating agent shall use the assets of the credit union to pay: First, expenses incidental to liquidating including any surety bond that may be required; and, second, any liability due nonmembers. Assets then remaining shall be distributed to the members proportionately to the shares and deposits held by each member as of the date dissolution was voted. (8) As soon as the board of directors or the liquidating agent determines that all assets from which there is a reasonable expectancy of realization have been liquidated and distributed as set forth in this section, they shall execute a certificate of dissolution on a form prescribed by the director and file the same, together with all pertinent books and records of the liquidating credit union, with the director, whereupon such credit union shall be dissolved.",

      "text": "Merger; opposition to merger. (1)(a) A credit union chartered in this state may, with the approval of the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, merge with another credit union under the existing charter of the other credit union pursuant to a plan that the majority of each board of directors of each credit union joining in the merger agrees to and that is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the merging credit union that vote on the merger. (b) The director may approve a merger without regard to common bond differences between the credit unions if one of the credit unions is insolvent or in danger of insolvency, and: (A) An emergency requiring expeditious action exists; (B) Other alternatives are not reasonably available; and (C) The public interest would best be served by approving the merger. (2) After the directors agree to a plan and the members of the merging credit union approve the plan, the president and secretary of the credit union shall execute a certificate of merger, which shall set forth all of the following: (a) The time and place of the meeting of the board of directors at which the board agreed to the plan. (b) The vote in favor of adopting the plan. (c) A copy of the resolution or other action by which the board agreed to the plan. (d) The time of the meeting of the members at which the members approved the plan. (e) The vote by which the members approved the plan. (3) The certificate and a copy of the plan of merger must be forwarded to the director, certified by the director and returned to the continuing credit union within 30 days. (4) After the director returns the certificate, all property, property rights and members interest of the merged credit union shall vest in the continuing credit union without deed, indorsement or other instrument of transfer, and the continuing credit union under whose charter the merger was effected assumes all debts, obligations and liabilities of the merged credit union. The rights and privileges of the members of the merged credit union remain intact. (5) This section permits a credit union chartered under the laws of another state or of the United States to merge with a credit union chartered under the laws of this state, and a credit union chartered under the laws of this state to merge with a credit union chartered under the laws of another state or of the United States, to the same extent that the laws of this state permit two or more credit unions chartered under the laws of this state to merge. (6)(a) After the board of directors of a credit union that is chartered in this state has approved a plan to merge with another credit union, if a member of the credit union opposes the plan to merge and wishes to inform other members of the credit union of the members opposition, the member may submit a proposed statement of opposition to the credit union and may ask the credit union to disseminate the statement of opposition to the other members. (b) If the credit union maintains on the Internet and publicizes to the credit unions members a public forum for communications concerning the plan to merge or other issues related to the credit union, the credit union, within 14 calendar days after receiving the proposed statement of opposition from the member and subject to paragraph (e) of this subsection, shall publish the statement of opposition on the public forum. (c) If the credit union does not make a public forum available on the Internet and if the credit union received the members proposed statement of opposition at least 28 days before the date on which the members of the credit union are to vote on the plan to merge, subject to paragraph (e) of this subsection, the credit union shall: (A) Notify the member, within seven days after receiving the statement of opposition, of: (i) Any limit, which may not be less than 500 words, that the credit union may impose on the length of the statement of opposition; and (ii) The estimated reasonable cost to reproduce and mail the statement of opposition as a stand-alone document or the estimated cost to include the statement of opposition in any informational or persuasive material concerning the plan to merge that the credit union disseminates to credit union members. The credit unions estimate of the cost of including the statement of opposition in the credit unions material may not exceed two cents multiplied by the number of the credit unions members. (B) Reproduce and mail the statement of opposition to the credit unions members or include the statement of opposition in the credit unions informational or persuasive materials concerning the plan to merge, within 10 days after receiving payment of the cost estimated in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph, if the member agrees to the limit the credit union imposes on the length of the statement of opposition and pays the cost at least 14 days before the date on which the members of the credit union are to vote on the plan to merge. (d) For purposes of paragraph (c) of this subsection, informational and persuasive material concerning the plan to merge does not include a notice of the meeting at which the credit unions members are to consider the plan to merge, a summary of the merger plan or other items that state or federal law requires the credit union to send to credit union members. (e)(A) The credit union shall notify the credit union member within seven days after receiving the proposed statement of opposition if the credit union declines to disseminate the statement of opposition because the statement of opposition: (i) Is false or misleading with respect to a material fact at the time and in light of the circumstances in which the statement is made; (ii) Omits a material fact that is necessary for the statement of fact not to be false or misleading; (iii) Relates to a personal claim or grievance or solicits personal gain by or business advantage for any party; (iv) Is not sufficiently related to the credit unions business or affairs; (v) Impugns, directly or indirectly, a persons character, integrity or personal reputation or without an expressed factual basis charges a person with illegal, improper or immoral conduct; or (vi) Impugns the stability or soundness of the credit union. (B) The credit union may decline to disseminate the proposed statement of opposition if the credit union member does not agree to the limits the credit union imposes on the length of the statement of opposition or fails within the time limits set in paragraph (c) of this subsection to pay the cost of mailing the statement or including the statement with the credit unions informational or persuasive material concerning the plan to merge. (C) The credit union may not decline to disseminate the statement of opposition for reasons other than the reasons identified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph. (f)(A) A credit union member may appeal to the director the credit unions decision under paragraph (e)(A) of this subsection not to disseminate the credit union members statement of opposition. An appeal under this paragraph is not a contested case, as defined in ORS 183.310, and a party to the appeal is not entitled to notice and an opportunity for a hearing under ORS 183.413 to 183.470. As part of the appeal, the credit union member shall provide the director with: (i) The proposed statement of opposition; (ii) A statement of reasons for disagreeing with the credit unions decision under paragraph (e)(A) of this subsection not to disseminate the statement of opposition; and (iii) The credit union members name, address and telephone number or other contact information. (B) Before issuing an order under this paragraph, the director shall request from the credit union a statement of reasons for declining to disseminate the proposed statement of opposition. The director shall consider the credit union members proposed statement of opposition and statement of reasons and the credit unions statement of reasons and shall arrive at an independent determination as to whether the credit union correctly declined to disseminate the credit union members proposed statement for the reasons identified in paragraph (e)(A) of this subsection. (C) The director by order shall uphold the credit unions decision under paragraph (e)(A) of this subsection or shall require the credit union to disseminate the credit union members proposed statement of opposition in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. The directors order is subject to appeal only as provided in ORS 183.484.",

(1) This section applies to the safe deposit box of any person who is the sole lessee or last surviving lessee of the box and who has died. (2) Subject to ORS 114.537, upon being furnished with a certified copy of the decedents death record or other evidence of death satisfactory to the credit union, the credit union within which the box is located shall cause or permit the box to be opened, and the contents of the box examined, at the request of an individual who furnishes an affidavit stating: (a) That the individual believes the box may contain the will of the decedent, a trust instrument creating a trust of which the decedent was a trustor or a trustee at the time of the decedents death, documents pertaining to the disposition of the remains of the decedent, documents pertaining to property of the estate of the decedent or property of the estate of the decedent; and (b) That the individual is an interested person and wishes to open the box to conduct a will search or trust instrument search, obtain documents relating to the disposition of the decedents remains or inventory the contents of the box or remove property of the estate of the decedent pursuant to a simple estate affidavit filed under ORS 114.515. (3) For the purpose of this section, interested person means any of the following: (a) A person named as personal representative of the decedent in a purported will of the decedent; (b) The surviving spouse or any heir of the decedent; (c) A person who was serving as the court-appointed guardian or conservator of the decedent or as trustee for the decedent immediately prior to the decedents death; (d) A person named as successor trustee in a purported trust instrument creating a trust of which the decedent was a trustor or a trustee at the time of the decedents death; (e) A person designated by the decedent in a writing that is acceptable to the credit union and is filed with it prior to the decedents death; (f) A person who immediately prior to the death of the decedent had the right of access to the box as an agent of the decedent under a durable power of attorney; (g) If there are no heirs of the decedent, an estate administrator of the State Treasurer appointed under ORS 113.235; or (h) A person who is authorized to file a simple estate affidavit under ORS 114.515. (4) If the box is opened for the purpose of conducting a will search, the credit union shall remove any document that appears to be a will, make a true and correct copy of it and deliver the original will to a person designated in the will to serve as the decedents personal representative, or if no such person is designated or the credit union cannot, despite reasonable efforts, determine the whereabouts of such person, the credit union shall retain the will or deliver it to a court having jurisdiction of the estate of the decedent. A copy of the will shall be retained in the box. At the request of the interested person, a copy of the will, together with copies of any documents pertaining to the disposition of the remains of the decedent, may be given to the interested person. (5) If the box is opened for the purpose of conducting a trust instrument search, the credit union shall remove any document that appears to be a trust instrument creating a trust of which the decedent was a trustor or trustee at the time of the decedents death, make a true and correct copy of it and deliver the original trust instrument to a person designated in the trust instrument to serve as the successor trustee on the death of the decedent. If no such person is designated or the credit union cannot, despite reasonable efforts, determine the whereabouts of such person, the credit union shall retain the trust instrument. A copy of the trust instrument shall be retained in the box. At the request of any interested person, a copy of the trust instrument may be given to the interested person. (6) If the box is opened for the purpose of obtaining documents pertaining to the disposition of the decedents remains, the credit union shall comply with subsection (4) or (5) of this section with respect to any will or trust instrument of the decedent found in the box, and may in its discretion either: (a) Make and retain in the box a copy of any documents pertaining to the disposition of the remains of the decedent and tender the original documents to the interested person; or (b) Provide a copy of any documents pertaining to the disposition of the remains of the decedent to the interested person and retain the original documents in the box. (7) If the box is opened for the purpose of making an inventory of its contents, the credit union shall comply with subsection (4) or (5) of this section with respect to any will or trust instrument of the decedent that is found in the box, and shall cause the inventory to be made. The inventory must be attested to by a representative of the credit union and may be attested to by the interested person, if the interested person is present when the inventory is made. The credit union shall retain the original inventory in the box, and shall furnish a copy of the inventory to the interested person upon request. (8) If the interested person is an affiant of a simple estate affidavit filed under ORS 114.515 and delivers a certified copy of the affidavit in the manner provided by ORS 114.535, the credit union shall provide to the affiant access to the decedents property. The credit union shall comply with subsection (4) or (5) of this section if a will or trust instrument of the decedent is found in the box. Subject to ORS 114.537, the credit union shall allow the affiant to take possession of the personal property in the box. (9) The credit union may presume the truth of any statement contained in the affidavit required to be furnished under this section and ORS 114.535, and when acting in reliance upon such an affidavit, the credit union is discharged as if it had dealt with the personal representative of the decedent. The credit union is not responsible for the adequacy of the description of any property included in an inventory of the contents of a box, or for the conversion of the property in connection with actions performed under this section, except for conversion by intentional acts of the credit union or its employees, directors, officers or agents. If the credit union is not satisfied that the requirements of this section have been satisfied, the credit union may decline to open the box. (10) If the interested person or affiant does not furnish the key needed to open the box, and the credit union must incur expense in gaining entry to the box, the credit union may require that the interested person or affiant pay the expense of opening the box. (11) Any examination of the contents of a box under this section shall be conducted in the presence of at least one employee of the credit union.",
