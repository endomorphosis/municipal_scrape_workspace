(5) The petition for creation of a subdistrict shall include a statement of the amount or quantity of water for which the subdistrict desires to acquire the perpetual use and the amount of money the subdistrict is willing to pay therefor. Prior to the entry of a judgment creating a subdistrict, the county board shall be furnished the verified consent of the district board to furnish such perpetual use of water for the purposes specified to the subdistrict at a price and upon the terms mentioned in the petition.",
