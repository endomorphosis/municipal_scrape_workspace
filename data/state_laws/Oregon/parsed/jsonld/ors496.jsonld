In addition to any other duties or powers provided by law, the State Fish and Wildlife Commission: (1) May accept, from whatever source, appropriations, gifts or grants of money or other property for the purposes of wildlife management, and use such money or property for wildlife management purposes. (2) May sell or exchange property owned by the state and used for wildlife management purposes when the commission determines that such sale or exchange would be advantageous to the state wildlife policy and management programs. (3) May acquire, introduce, propagate and stock wildlife species in such manner as the commission determines will carry out the state wildlife policy and management programs. (4) May by rule authorize the issuance of such licenses, tags and permits for angling, taking, hunting and trapping and may prescribe such tagging and sealing procedures as the commission determines necessary to carry out the provisions of the wildlife laws or to obtain information for use in wildlife management. Permits issued pursuant to this subsection may include special hunting permits for a person and immediate family members of the person to hunt on land owned by that person in areas where permits for deer or elk are limited by quota. As used in this subsection, immediate family members means spouses in a marriage, parents, brothers, brothers-in-law, sisters, sisters-in-law, sons, sons-in-law, daughters, daughters-in-law, stepchildren and grandchildren. A landowner who is qualified to receive landowner preference tags from the commission may request two additional tags for providing public access and two additional tags for wildlife habitat programs. This request shall be made to the Access and Habitat Board with supporting evidence that the access is significant and the habitat programs benefit wildlife. The board may recommend that the commission grant the request. When a landowner is qualified under landowner preference rules adopted by the commission and receives a controlled hunt tag for that unit or a landowner preference tag for the landowners property and does not use the tag during the regular season, the landowner may use that tag to take an antlerless animal, when approved by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, to alleviate damage that is presently occurring to the landowners property. (5) May by rule prescribe procedures requiring the holder of any license, tag or permit issued pursuant to the wildlife laws to keep records and make reports concerning the time, manner and place of taking wildlife, the quantities taken and such other information as the commission determines necessary for proper enforcement of the wildlife laws or to obtain information for use in wildlife management. (6) May establish special hunting and angling areas or seasons in which only persons less than 18 years of age or over 65 years of age are permitted to hunt or angle. (7) May acquire by purchase, lease, agreement or gift real property and all appropriate interests therein for wildlife management and wildlife-oriented recreation purposes. (8) May acquire by purchase, lease, agreement, gift, exercise of eminent domain or otherwise real property and all interests therein and establish, operate and maintain thereon public hunting areas. (9) May establish and develop wildlife refuge and management areas and prescribe rules governing the use of such areas and the use of wildlife refuge and management areas established and developed pursuant to any other provision of law. (10) May by rule prescribe fees for licenses, tags, permits and applications issued or required pursuant to the wildlife laws, and user charges for angling, hunting or other recreational uses of lands owned or managed by the commission, unless such fees or user charges are otherwise prescribed by law. No fee or user charge prescribed by the commission pursuant to this subsection shall exceed $250. (11) May enter into contracts with any person or governmental agency for the development and encouragement of wildlife research and management programs and projects. (12) May perform such acts as may be necessary for the establishment and implementation of cooperative wildlife management programs with agencies of the federal government. (13) May offer and pay rewards for the arrest and conviction of any person who has violated any of the wildlife laws. No such reward shall exceed $1,000 for any one arrest and conviction. (14) May by rule prescribe fees for falconry licenses issued pursuant to the wildlife laws, unless such fees are otherwise prescribed by law. Fees prescribed by the commission pursuant to this subsection shall be based on actual or projected costs of administering falconry regulations and shall not exceed $250. (15) May establish special fishing and hunting seasons and bag limits applicable only to persons with disabilities. (16) May adopt optimum populations for deer and elk consistent with ORS 496.012. These population levels shall be reviewed at least once every five years. (17) Shall establish a preference system so that individuals who are unsuccessful in controlled hunt permit drawings for deer and elk hunting have reasonable assurance of success in those drawings in subsequent years. In establishing the preference system, the commission shall consider giving additional preference points to persons who have been issued a resident annual pioneer combination license pursuant to ORS 497.132 or resident disabled veteran hunting license under ORS 497.102. (18) May sell advertising in State Department of Fish and Wildlife publications, including annual hunting and angling regulation publications. (19) May, notwithstanding the fees required by ORS 497.112, provide free hunting tags to an organization that sponsors hunting trips for terminally ill children. Except as provided under ORS 497.116, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife may not issue more than 15 tags annually under this subsection. (20) Shall, after consultation with the State Department of Agriculture, adopt rules prohibiting the use of the World Wide Web, other Internet protocols or broadcast or closed circuit media to remotely control a weapon for the purpose of hunting any game bird, wildlife, game mammal or other mammal. The rules may exempt the State Department of Fish and Wildlife or agents of the department from the prohibition. (21) May adopt rules establishing a schedule of civil penalties, not to exceed $6,500 per violation, for violations of provisions of the wildlife laws or rules adopted by the commission under the wildlife laws. Civil penalties established under this subsection must be imposed in the manner provided by ORS 183.745 and must be deposited in the State Wildlife Fund established under ORS 496.300. (22) May by rule impose a surcharge not to exceed $25 for the renewal of a hunting license on any person who fails to comply with mandatory hunting reporting requirements. Amounts collected as surcharges under this subsection must be deposited in the State Wildlife Fund established under ORS 496.300. (23)(a) May by rule establish annual and daily Columbia Basin salmon, steelhead and sturgeon recreational fishing endorsements with a fee not to exceed $9.75 per annual license and $1 per day per daily license. An endorsement is required to fish for salmon, steelhead or sturgeon in portions of the Columbia Basin as designated by rule and is in addition to and not in lieu of angling licenses and tags required under the wildlife laws. Amounts collected as fees under this subsection must be deposited in the Columbia River Fisheries Enhancement Fund established under section 7, chapter 672, Oregon Laws 2013. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, if the commission adopts rules that decrease fishery impacts or the share of salmon allocated to Columbia River recreational fisheries or that expand the areas and seasons where nontribal gillnets are permitted in mainstem lower Columbia River nontribal fisheries as compared to regulatory restrictions in place from 2017 to 2020, the commission may not require or collect the endorsements, beginning in the following calendar year. (24) May by rule establish multiyear licenses and may prescribe fees for such licenses. Fees prescribed by the commission for multiyear licenses may provide for a discount from the annual license fees that would otherwise be payable for the period of time covered by the multiyear license. (25) May by rule establish a program to offer unique fishing opportunities through drawings, raffles or auctions and charge application and participation fees for the program.

Within 90 days of such notice, the department shall recommend reasonable and prudent alternatives, if any, to the proposed action which are consistent with the guidelines. (4) If a state agency fails to adopt the recommendations made under subsection (3) of this section, it shall, after consultation with the department, demonstrate that: (a) The potential public benefits of the proposed action outweigh the potential harm from failure to adopt the recommendations; and (b) Reasonable mitigation and enhancement measures shall be taken, to the extent practicable, to minimize the adverse impact of the action on the affected species. (5) When an action under this section is initiated by a person other than a state agency, the agency shall provide final approval or denial of the proposed action within 120 days of receipt of a written request for final determination. (6) The provisions of this section do not apply to lands acquired through foreclosures of loans made pursuant to programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs. (7) State land owning or managing agencies shall set priorities for establishing endangered species management plans required by subsection (8) of this section after consultation with the commission on the level of biological threat and, in consideration of available funds, the immediacy and seriousness of the threat to any listed species. (8)(a)(A) Within four months of the listing of an endangered species, the commission, in consultation and cooperation with the state land owning or managing agency, shall determine if state land can play a role in the conservation of endangered species. The commission and the land owning or managing agency shall consider species biology and geography of the land base to determine if the species or its habitat is found on state land. If the species or its habitat is not found on state land, the commission shall determine that state land has no role to play in the conservation of the species. (B) If the species or its habitat is found on state land, the land owning or managing agency, in consultation with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, shall determine the role its state land shall serve in the conservation of the endangered species. This role may include, but is not limited to conservation, contribution toward conservation or take avoidance. To carry out its consulting role under this subsection, the department shall provide state agencies with an assessment of the conservation needs of the endangered species. In making this determination, the land owning or managing agency shall balance the statutory requirements, rules and policies applicable to the agencys programs, the social and economic impacts that conservation would have on the state, the conservation needs of the species, the purpose of the land and the roles of other ownership categories. The agency shall balance these factors consistent with the commissions rules related to the biological aspects of species management and the statutory obligations of the land owning or managing agency, including the statutory purpose of the land. (C) After determining the role its state land shall serve in conservation of the species, the land owning or managing agency, in consultation with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife and consistent with the commissions rules related to endangered species management plans, shall develop and approve an endangered species management plan within 18 months from the date the species is first listed as endangered. Endangered species management plans shall be based on the statutes, rules and policies applicable to the agencys programs and shall take into account any social or economic impacts that the plan may have on the state. The land owning or managing agency shall submit the plan to the commission for review and approval as provided in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph. (D) The commission shall review the endangered species management plan approved by the land owning or managing agency under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph to determine whether the plan achieves the role defined for the land under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. Based on the biology of the endangered species the commission may modify the endangered species management plan if necessary to be consistent with the role the land owning or managing agency has defined for the land under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph and shall approve the plan as submitted or modified within 24 months from the date the species is listed as endangered. (b) For state agencies other than land owning or managing agencies, the commission, in consultation and cooperation with the agency, shall determine whether the agency can serve a role in the conservation of endangered species. If the commission determines that the agency has a role to play in conservation of the endangered species, the agency shall determine what role it shall serve in conservation of the endangered species. The agency shall make this determination as provided in the commissions rules related to the biological aspects of species management and in a manner consistent with the agencys statutory obligations.

Section 2 of this 2019 Act is added to and made a part of ORS chapter 496. [2019 c.532 1] Sec. 2. (1) The State Department of Fish and Wildlife may refuse to disclose information described in subsection (3) of this section regarding the habitat, location or population of a fish or wildlife species that is: (a) Listed by the federal government or by the State Fish and Wildlife Commission as a threatened species or an endangered species; (b) Under consideration by the commission for listing as a threatened species or an endangered species; or (c) A sensitive species as defined by the department by rule. (2) The department may refuse to disclose data described in subsection (3) of this section if: (a) The species has value as a commercial species or game species, or has black market value; (b) There exists a history of harm to a local population of the species from malicious or unlawful behavior, accidental taking, disturbance or harassment and the behavior or ecology of the species makes the species especially vulnerable to that harm; (c) There is a known demand for illegally taking or harassing the species; or (d) The species has limited distribution and concentration or is an endemic species. (3) The department may refuse to disclose telemetry, radio frequency or other locational data about a species, an individual member of a species or the habitat of a species or individual member of a species, that are described in subsection (1) or (2) of this section if the data concern: (a) Present, projected or recent past locations of individual members or populations of the species; (b) Present, projected or recent past habitat used by the species, including but not limited to habitat used for breeding, nesting, denning, migration, dispersal or other sensitive or vulnerable life stages, if disclosure of the habitat could be expected to lead to discovery of the location of the species or of an individual member of the species; (c) Results or other specific information from the unpublished data and findings of research, monitoring or evaluation efforts conducted by the state or by an entity acting jointly with the state; or (d) Confidential information provided on a voluntary basis by private landowners or representatives of private landowners. (4) The department may disclose data that may be withheld under subsections (1) to (3) of this section to a requester that is one or more of the following: (a) The federal government, a tribal government, a public body as defined in ORS 174.109, a public utility or an accredited college or university; (b) Owners of, lessees of rights-of-way in or holders of easements on private land to which the data pertain; (c) Holders of public grazing permits for the land to which the data pertain; (d) Owners of agricultural land or forestland, if the disclosure might prevent loss to an agricultural or forest operation; and (e) Resource management partners and stakeholders. (5) The department shall require a recipient of information disclosed under subsection (4)(b) to (e) of this section to sign an agreement to maintain the confidentiality of the information. The agreement may include, but need not be limited to, a proposed protective order for use, if necessary, in a legal proceeding to maintain confidentiality of the information. If the department is prohibited under subsection (8) of this section from withholding the information, the agreement may prohibit the recipient from disclosing the information, except to further the protection or conservation of a species in a manner described in subsection (8) of this section. (6) A disclosure of information under subsection (4) of this section does not require that the department disclose the information to any other party. (7) Subsections (1) to (3) of this section may not be used to withhold data, studies or other information about the total numbers or health of a species in this state or in a region of this state. (8) The department may not withhold information under subsection (3) of this section if the information is relevant to: (a) An ongoing petition, litigation or other administrative or legal action in furtherance of the protection or conservation of a species; or (b) The preparation of a petition, or for a litigation or other administrative or legal action, in furtherance of the protection or conservation of a species. (9) If the department provides data described in this section, to the extent practicable the department shall aggregate the data to a scale that does not create a risk to the fish or wildlife species or members of the species.

(1) The lists of threatened species or endangered species established pursuant to ORS 496.172 (2) shall include: (a) Those species of wildlife listed as of May 15, 1987, as a threatened species or an endangered species pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-205, 16 U.S.C. 1531), as amended; and (b) Those species determined as of May 15, 1987, by the State Fish and Wildlife Commission to be threatened species or endangered species. (2) The commission, by rule, may add or remove any wildlife species from either list, or change the status of any species on the lists, upon a determination that the species is or is not a threatened species or an endangered species. (3) A determination that a species is a threatened species or an endangered species shall be based on documented and verifiable scientific information about the species biological status. To list a species as a threatened species or an endangered species under ORS 496.004 and 496.171 to 496.182, the commission shall determine that the natural reproductive potential of the species is in danger of failure due to limited population numbers, disease, predation or other natural or human actions affecting its continued existence and, to the extent possible, assess the relative impact of human actions. In addition, the commission shall determine that one or more of the following factors exists: (a) That most populations are undergoing imminent or active deterioration of their range or primary habitat; (b) That overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific or educational purposes is occurring or is likely to occur; or (c) That existing state or federal programs or regulations are inadequate to protect the species or its habitat. (4) Determinations required by subsection (3) of this section shall be made by the commission on the basis of verifiable scientific and other data after consultation with federal agencies, other interested state agencies, private landowners, affected cities, affected counties, affected local service districts as defined in ORS 174.116, other states having a common interest in the species and interested persons and organizations. (5)(a) Any person may petition the commission to, by rule, add, remove or change the status of a species on the list. (b) A petition shall clearly indicate the action sought and shall include documented scientific information about the species biological status to justify the requested action. (c) Within 90 days of receipt of a petition, the commission shall respond in writing to the petitioner indicating whether the petition presents substantial scientific information to warrant the action requested. (d) If the petition is found to present such information, the commission shall commence rulemaking. (e) A final determination by the commission concerning the action requested in a petition shall be provided within one year from the date of receipt of the petition, with the option for an additional 12-month extension of time to complete the listing if the commission determines that limited information or other appropriate considerations require the extension. (f) If the petition is denied, the petitioner may seek judicial review as provided in ORS 183.484. (6) The commission may determine not to list a species as a threatened species or an endangered species in any of the following cases: (a) If the species has been listed pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-205, 16 U.S.C. 1531), as amended. (b) If the species is currently on the list as a sensitive species, or is a candidate species or has been petitioned for listing pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-205, 16 U.S.C. 1531), as amended. (c) If the species has been determined, pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-205, 16 U.S.C. 1531), as amended, to not qualify as a threatened species or an endangered species. (7)(a) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (5) of this section, the commission shall take emergency action to add a species to the list of threatened species or endangered species if it determines there is a significant threat to the continued existence of the species within the state. (b) The commission shall publish notice of such addition in the Secretary of States bulletin and shall mail notice to affected or interested persons whose names are included on the commissions mailing list for such purposes. (c) Such emergency addition shall take effect immediately upon publication in the Secretary of States bulletin and shall remain valid for a period no longer than one year, unless during the period the commission completes rulemaking procedures as provided in subsection (5) of this section. (8) The commission shall periodically review the status of all threatened species and endangered species listed under ORS 496.171 to 496.192. Each species shall be reviewed at least once every five years to determine whether verifiable scientific information exists to justify its reclassification or removal from the list, according to the criteria listed under subsections (3) and (4) of this section. If a determination is made to reclassify a species or remove it from the list, the commission, within 90 days, shall commence rulemaking to change the status of the species. (9) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the commission: (a) May decide not to list a species that otherwise qualifies as a threatened or endangered species within this state if the commission determines that the species is secure outside this state or the species is not of cultural, scientific or commercial significance to the people of this state. (b) May not include Branta canadensis leucopareia, commonly known as the Aleutian Canada goose, on the lists of threatened species or endangered species.",

These management programs may include: (i) Creating hunting lease programs that provide access at present levels or stimulate new access. (ii) Controlling access. (iii) Opening vehicle access. (iv) Promoting land exchanges. (v) Promoting proper hunting behavior. (B) Through the acquisition of easements. (c) On programs that would provide for wildlife feeding to alleviate damage, to intercept wildlife before wildlife becomes involved in a damage situation and for practical food replacement in severe winters. (d) On programs to coordinate volunteers to improve habitat, repair damage to fences or roads by wildlife or recreationists, monitor orderly hunter utilization of public and private lands and assist the Oregon State Police in law enforcement activities. (e) On programs that provide for auction or raffle of tags to provide incentives for habitat or access.

(c) Healthy native migratory fish population means a population of native migratory fish that, as determined by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife: (A) Demonstrates appropriate life stages throughout the year; and (B) Reproduces at sufficient levels to be a self-sustaining population into the foreseeable future. (d) Incised or eroded stream means a stream that has been scoured by erosion to the extent that the channel bed elevation has lowered relative to its ancient floodplain and the stream has lost connectivity with the ancient floodplain, as characterized by: (A) The loss of natural wetland, riparian or meadow conditions in the adjacent surfaces; (B) The absence of overbank flooding or deposition during ordinary periods of high streamflow; (C) The loss of diversity of fish or other species; or (D) The presence of invasive dry land species that have encroached from adjacent uplands, including but not limited to sagebrush, bunch grass, juniper and pine. (e) Native migratory fish has the meaning given that term in ORS 509.580. (f) Qualifying stream means an incised or eroded stream, a designated reach of an incised or eroded stream or a designated set of adjacent reaches of an incised or eroded stream that, prior to commencement of a project authorized pursuant to subsection (2) of this section: (A) Has an estimated median monthly natural streamflow of less than one cubic foot per second during at least two months of the year; (B) Has not had a healthy native migratory fish population for at least three years prior to the time of authorization; and (C) Is incised or eroded to the extent that the channel bed elevation has lowered by two feet or more relative to the elevation of the ancient floodplain. (g) Reach means a section of a stream that is similar in flow topography and habitat characteristics and is between 50 and 500 feet in length. (h) Summit of the Cascade Mountains has the meaning given that term in ORS 321.805. (2) The State Department of Fish and Wildlife shall adopt by rule and administer a program for authorizing voluntary projects for stream restoration and habitat improvement through the construction of environmental restoration weirs. The department may only authorize a project under the program if: (a) The project involves construction of environmental restoration weirs on one or more qualifying streams located in any closed basin: (A) From which water does not flow to the Pacific Ocean; and (B) That is located east of the summit of the Cascade Mountains; (b) Construction of the environmental restoration weirs will be completed no later than July 1, 2031; and (c) The project complies with local floodplain regulations if the project is located within an area subject to floodplain management. (3) Rules adopted under subsection (2) of this section shall identify criteria for evaluating voluntary projects undertaken pursuant to the program. (4) If the department determines that native migratory fish are present in a qualifying stream prior to the date of construction of environmental restoration weirs, the person engaging in the proposed voluntary project shall provide fish passage pursuant to ORS 509.585. (5)(a) If the department determines that native migratory fish are not present in a qualifying stream prior to the date of construction of environmental restoration weirs, the person engaging in the proposed voluntary project is exempt from meeting the requirements of ORS 509.585. (b) If, after construction of environmental restoration weirs, the department determines that native migratory fish have returned to the qualifying stream, the department may require the person engaging in the authorized voluntary restoration project to: (A) Provide fish passage that: (i) Is economically practicable to the person engaging in the voluntary restoration project; and (ii) Can be constructed from locally available natural materials; or (B) Provide mitigation that, as determined by the department, provides a net benefit to native migratory fish. (6) For a period of up to 10 years after construction of the environmental restoration weirs is complete, the department: (a) Shall require the person that engaged in an authorized voluntary project to maintain the environmental restoration weirs for their stream restoration and habitat improvement values; (b) May require the person to engage in photo monitoring of the environmental restoration weirs; and (c) May, subject to subsection (9) of this section, require the person to allow a third party to engage in monitoring of the environmental restoration weirs. (7) The department shall, in coordination with the Water Resources Department, require the person to modify the environmental restoration weirs if the environmental restoration weirs are found: (a) By the Water Resources Department to result in injury to an existing water right; or (b) By the State Department of Fish and Wildlife to be having a significant detrimental impact on native migratory fish. (8)(a) Before authorizing a proposed voluntary project, the State Department of Fish and Wildlife shall coordinate with the Department of Transportation to consider any potential impacts of the project on transportation infrastructure or planned transportation infrastructure, including but not limited to potential impacts on roads, culverts and bridges. (b) The State Department of Fish and Wildlife, in coordination with the Department of Transportation, may at any time require the person engaging in the authorized voluntary restoration project to modify environmental restoration weirs if the environmental restoration weirs are found to adversely impact transportation infrastructure or planned transportation infrastructure. (9) If the State Department of Fish and Wildlife requires third-party monitoring of environmental restoration weirs under subsection (6)(c) of this section: (a) The third party must be chosen through mutual agreement between the person engaging in the voluntary restoration project and the department; (b) The person engaging in the voluntary restoration project may not unreasonably withhold consent for the third party to engage in monitoring; (c) The third-party monitoring may not result in a financial cost to the person engaging in the voluntary restoration project; and (d) The third party engaging in the monitoring must be covered by sufficient liability and casualty insurance. (10) Planting or removal of brush and trees from stream banks and riparian areas as part of an authorized voluntary project are not subject to riparian management requirements established under the Oregon Forest Practices Act. (11) Nothing in this section creates any new requirement or exemption with respect to obtaining a permit or certificate to use, store or appropriate water. [2021 c.63 3] Note: See note under",

Options and means shall include operation of salmon production facilities, in cooperation with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, by both public and private nonprofit agencies as well as by public local partnerships, to meet local production and harvest needs as well as to help restore and maintain natural salmon spawning populations. Such cooperative production projects shall be operated using scientifically sound hatchery practices and shall be consistent with objectives to protect and restore natural fish production. (2) The State Department of Fish and Wildlife shall: (a) Review and revise existing state administrative rules so that the different forms of hatchery production are recognized as a necessary and critical element in the states salmon production system in order to provide harvest opportunities for Oregons citizens. In so doing, the department shall identify low natural production areas and, using genetically compatible stocks approved by the department, encourage volunteer efforts such as the salmon and trout enhancement program to maintain and to enhance production. (b) Identify existing private and public salmon production facilities that are currently either underutilized or subject to decommissioning and that may be appropriate for other forms of operation. (c) Inventory other appropriate local sites, identify possible types of production facilities, recommend stock selection and release size, and assist in securing the acquisition of brood stock approved by the department that maximizes local production. (d) Investigate and implement ways to improve hatchery smolt survival and reduce predation by such means as night releases, net pen acclimation, alternate release sites, volitional and other release strategies, transport and other means that may be effective and consistent with the conservation of native salmon and genetic resources. (e) Make recommendations on methods by which operations of facilities referred to in this subsection and subsection (3) of this section can generate revenue for sustainable production, including but not limited to state bonding, license surcharges, ad valorem taxes, local economic development funds, service districts, sale of excess eggs and salmon, and gifts, grants and donations. (f) Identify needed monitoring and evaluation activities to ensure protection of natural spawning fish populations and to assess the contribution of such cooperative projects to public fisheries. (g) Assist in developing, for department approval, plans of operation for such cooperative hatchery projects consistent with applicable rules and standards of sound, scientific fish management practice. (3) The department shall encourage and assist in planning hatchery facilities that seek to implement innovative plans or programs designed to meet production for harvest needs consistent with conservation objectives. (4) The State Fish and Wildlife Commission shall approve, prior to implementation, operational plans for any fish propagation facilities operated by contractor agreement with other state or federal agencies, local governments, special districts and nonprofit organizations.

(2) Landowner preference tags may be used only for hunting on the landowners property. (3) Subject to subsection (6) of this section, landowner preference tags for the hunting of deer or elk may be transferred to any person of the landowners choosing and shall be used for the taking of antlerless animals. (4) Landowner preference tags for the hunting of antelope are not transferable and may not be used for the taking of buck antelope.

(6) Landowner preference tags for the hunting of deer or elk may be transferred to a person of the landowners choosing as follows: (a) A landowner who is issued only one tag may not transfer that tag. (b) A landowner who is issued two or more tags may transfer not more than 50 percent of the tags to a person who is not an immediate family member, as defined in ORS 496.146 (4).

(7)(a) As specified pursuant to a formula determined by the commission by rule, the number of landowner preference tags issued for mule deer must be based upon the management, research and habitat needs set forth in the wildlife management plan for mule deer. (b) If the population of mule deer in a wildlife management unit is greater than the goal specified in the wildlife management plan for mule deer, a landowner who is issued a landowner preference tag is eligible, pursuant to criteria established by rule of the commission, for the number of tags that corresponds to the number of acres that landowner has registered with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife for participation in the program. (c) The commission may specify by rule a formula for determining the number of landowner preference tags that are available for controlled hunts for mule deer in a wildlife management unit in which the population of mule deer is less than the goal specified for that wildlife management unit in the wildlife management plan for mule deer. (8) Landowners shall pay the applicable fee under ORS 497.061 to register for participation in the program.

(1) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, whenever real property owned by the State Fish and Wildlife Commission is exempt from taxation on January 1 of any year by reason of its ownership by the state, the commission shall pay to the county in which the property is situated an amount equal to the ad valorem taxes that would have been charged against the property if it had been assessed to a taxable owner as of January 1 of such year as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The county assessor shall determine the value of such property and shall notify the commission of the determination of the county assessor. Upon request of the commission, the Department of Revenue shall review the determination of value and shall redetermine the value if it concludes the value initially determined was substantially incorrect. (2)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this subsection, the value of the property shall be computed at its assessed value under ORS 308A.107 or for forestland use, whichever is applicable. (b) Paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not apply to any property upon which open field burning takes place. If open field burning takes place on any property described in this section, the property shall be valued at its highest and best use rather than the values authorized in paragraph (a) of this subsection on the January 1 following the date of the open field burning. If in the next year, the open field burning is discontinued, paragraph (a) of this subsection shall apply the next January 1 and each year thereafter as long as no open field burning occurs. (c) Paragraph (a) of this subsection shall not apply to any property acquired by the commission after September 9, 1971, if such property was valued under farm use or forestland use special assessment provisions, at the time the property was acquired by the commission. However, no payments in lieu of taxes made to a county pursuant to this section prior to January 1, 1974, shall be refunded to the commission. (3) This section does not apply to real property used for bird farms, fish hatcheries, office quarters, fishing access sites or impoundments, capital improvements or real property acquired pursuant to the Act of May 19, 1948 (62 Stat. 240), Public Law 80-537. (4) The amount prescribed in subsection (1) of this section shall be determined annually by the assessor of the county in which the property is situated and certified by the assessor to the county court or the board of county commissioners. A notice of the determination, signed by the county judge or the chairperson of the board of county commissioners, shall be mailed to the principal office of the commission not later than October 15. The notice shall contain a statement of the value of the property and a complete explanation of the method used in computing the amount claimed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section. Not later than November 15, the commission shall pay each amount, less a discount equivalent to that which is provided in ORS 311.505. Payment shall be made to the county treasurer, who shall distribute the payment to the taxing districts of the county in accordance with the schedule of percentages computed under ORS 311.390. (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of the wildlife laws, the commission shall make the payments to counties required by this section annually from the moneys in the State Wildlife Fund established by ORS 496.300.",

As used in this section and ORS 496.435 to 496.455: (1) Enhancement means resource conservation, utilization and educational activities that contribute to the recovery and sustainability of native fish. (2) Listed unit means one population or a group of populations of a species, such as an evolutionarily significant unit, that has been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-205), as amended, or under ORS 496.171 to 496.192. (3) Native fish means indigenous to Oregon and not introduced. Naturally produced fish and hatchery produced fish are both native fish if the fish are indigenous to Oregon and not introduced. (4) Native stocks means those fish indigenous to Oregon that naturally propagate in a given watershed. (5) Naturally produced means a fish that reproduces and completes its full life cycle in its natural habitat. The naturally produced progeny of hatchery fish are naturally produced. (6) Population means a group of fish that: (a) Originates and reproduces in a particular area at a particular time; (b) Does not interbreed to any substantial degree with any other group reproducing in a different area or in the same area at a different time; and (c) Is composed of naturally produced fish, hatchery produced fish or a combination of both. (7) Recovery means that a proportion of the constituent populations of naturally produced native fish belonging to a listed unit are sufficiently abundant, productive and diverse in life histories and distribution such that the listed unit as a whole will be self-sustaining into the foreseeable future. (8) Self-sustaining means having a sufficient proportion and distribution of constituent populations that: (a) Are likely to survive prolonged periods of habitat, oceanic, climatic and environmental conditions that are detrimental to a population; and (b) Have habitat of sufficient quality and quantity that is likely to provide survival rates adequate to maintain associated ecological, cultural and economic benefits.",

      "text": "Wildlife Law Violator Compact. The Wildlife Violator Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into on behalf of this state with all other states legally joining therein in a form substantially as follows: ______________________________________________________________________________ ARTICLE I FINDINGS, DECLARATION OF POLICY AND PURPOSE (a) The party states find that: (1) Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors. (2) The protection of their respective wildlife resources can be materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statute, law, regulation, ordinance or administrative rule relating to the management of those resources. (3) The preservation, protection, management and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational and economic aspects of these natural resources. (4) Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries, therefore, all persons should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management and restoration laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations of all party states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap or possess wildlife. (5) Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property. (6) The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communications among the various states. (7) In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than the persons home state: (i) Must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date; or (ii) If unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or (iii) Is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance. (8) The purpose of the enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision is to insure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the person who, if permitted to continue on the persons way after receiving the citation, could return to the persons home state and disregard the persons duty under the terms of the citation. (9) In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in the persons home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on the persons way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation. (10) The practice described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement can be made. (11) The enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision consume an undue amount of law enforcement time. (b) It is the policy of the party states to: (1) Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations and administrative rules relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states. (2) Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges of any person whose license privileges have been suspended by a party state and treat this suspension as if it had occurred in their state. (3) Allow violators to accept a wildlife citation, except as provided in subdivision (b) of Article III, and proceed on the violators way without delay whether or not the person is a resident in the state in which the citation was issued, provided that the violators home state is party to this compact. (4) Report to the appropriate party state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against any person whose home state was not the issuing state. (5) Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded for their residents which occurred in another party state as if they had occurred in the home state. (6) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the party states for obtaining compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one party state to a resident of another party state. (7) Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information. (8) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations. (c) The purpose of this compact is to: (1) Provide a means through which the party states may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate policies enumerated in subdivision (b) of this Article in a uniform and orderly manner. (2) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within party states in recognition of the persons right of due process and the sovereign status of a party state. ARTICLE II DEFINITIONS As used in this compact, unless the context requires otherwise: (a) Citation means any summons, complaint, ticket, penalty assessment or other official document issued by a wildlife officer or other peace officer for a wildlife violation containing an order which requires the person to respond. (b) Collateral means any cash or other security deposited to secure an appearance for trial, in connection with the issuance by a wildlife officer or other peace officer of a citation for a wildlife violation. (c) Compliance with respect to a citation means the act of answering the citation through appearance at a court, a tribunal or payment of fines, costs and surcharges, if any, or both such appearance and payment. (d) Conviction means a conviction, including any court conviction, of any offense related to the preservation, protection, management or restoration of wildlife which is prohibited by state statute, law, regulation, ordinance or administrative rule, or a forfeiture of bail, bond or other security deposited to secure appearance by a person charged with having committed any such offense, or payment of a penalty assessment, or a plea of nolo contendere, or the imposition of a deferred or suspended sentence by the court. (e) Court means a court of law, including Magistrates Court and Justice Court. (f) Home state means the state of primary residence of a person. (g) Issuing state means the party state which issues a wildlife citation to the violator. (h) License means any license, permit or other public document which conveys to the person to whom it was issued the privilege of pursuing, possessing or taking any wildlife regulated by statute, law, regulation, ordinance or administrative rule of a party state. (i) Licensing authority means the department or division within each party state which is authorized by law to issue or approve licenses or permits to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife. (j) Party state means any state which enacts legislation to become a member of this Wildlife Compact. (k) Personal recognizance means an agreement by a person made at the time of issuance of the wildlife citation that the person will comply with the terms of that citation. (L) State means any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Provinces of Canada or other countries. (m) Suspension means any revocation, denial or withdrawal of any or all license privileges, including the privilege to apply for, purchase or exercise the benefits conferred by any license. (n) Terms of the citation means those conditions and options expressly stated upon the citation. (o) Wildlife means all species of animals, including but not necessarily limited to mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, mollusks and crustaceans, which are defined as wildlife and are protected or otherwise regulated by statute, law, regulation, ordinance or administrative rule in a party state. Species included in the definition of wildlife vary from state to state and determination of whether a species is wildlife for the purposes of this compact shall be based on local law. (p) Wildlife law means any statute, law, regulation, ordinance or administrative rule developed and enacted to manage wildlife resources and the use thereof. (q) Wildlife officer means any individual authorized by a party state to issue a citation for a wildlife violation. (r) Wildlife violation means any cited violation of a statute, law, regulation, ordinance or administrative rule developed and enacted to manage wildlife resources and the use thereof. ARTICLE III PROCEDURES FOR ISSUING STATE (a) When issuing a citation for a wildlife violation, a wildlife officer shall issue a citation to any person whose primary residence is in a party state in the same manner as if the person were a resident of the home state and shall not require the person to post collateral to secure appearance, subject to the exceptions contained in subdivision (b) of this Article, if the officer receives the persons personal recognizance that the person will comply with the terms of the citation. (b) Personal recognizance is acceptable: (1) If not prohibited by local law or the compact manual; and (2) If the violator provides adequate proof of the violators identification to the wildlife officer. (c) Upon conviction or failure of a person to comply with the terms of a wildlife citation, the appropriate official shall report the conviction or failure to comply to the licensing authority of the party state in which the wildlife citation was issued. The report shall be made in accordance with procedures specified by the issuing state and shall contain the information specified in the compact manual as minimum requirements for effective processing by the home state. (d) Upon receipt of the report of conviction or noncompliance required by subdivision (c) of this Article, the licensing authority of the issuing state shall transmit to the licensing authority in the home state of the violator the information in a form and content as contained in the compact manual. ARTICLE IV PROCEDURES FOR HOME STATE (a) Upon receipt of a report of failure to comply with the terms of a citation from the licensing authority of the issuing state, the licensing authority of the home state shall notify the violator, shall initiate a suspension action in accordance with the home states suspension procedures and shall suspend the violators license privileges until satisfactory evidence of compliance with the terms of the wildlife citation has been furnished by the issuing state to the home state licensing authority. Due process safeguards will be accorded. (b) Upon receipt of a report of conviction from the licensing authority of the issuing state, the licensing authority of the home state shall enter such conviction in its records and shall treat such conviction as if it occurred in the home state for the purposes of the suspension of license privileges. (c) The licensing authority of the home state shall maintain a record of actions taken and make reports to issuing states as provided in the compact manual. ARTICLE V RECIPROCAL RECOGNITION OF SUSPENSION All party states shall recognize the suspension of license privileges of any person by any state as if the violation on which the suspension is based had in fact occurred in their state and could have been the basis for suspension of license privileges in their state. ARTICLE VI APPLICABILITY OF OTHER LAWS Except as expressly required by provisions of this compact, nothing herein shall be construed to affect the right of any party state to apply any of its laws relating to license privileges to any person or circumstance, or to invalidate or prevent any agreement or other cooperative arrangements between a party state and a nonparty state concerning wildlife law enforcement. ARTICLE VII COMPACT ADMINISTRATOR PROCEDURES (a) For the purpose of administering the provisions of this compact and to serve as a governing body for the resolution of all matters relating to the operation of this compact, a board of compact administrators is established. The board shall be composed of one representative from each of the party states to be known as the compact administrator. The compact administrator shall be appointed by the head of the licensing authority of each party state and will serve and be subject to removal in accordance with the laws of the state the administrator represents. A compact administrator may provide for the discharge of the administrators duties and the performance of the administrators functions as a board member by an alternate. An alternate may not be entitled to serve unless written notification of the alternates identity has been given to the board. (b) Each member of the board of compact administrators shall be entitled to one vote.
